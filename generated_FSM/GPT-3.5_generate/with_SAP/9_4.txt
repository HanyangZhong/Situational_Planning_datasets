First, let's identify the possible states and actions based on the given scene:

States:
1. Initial State: Start with an assessment.
2. Assess Situation State: Assess the medication management situation.
3. Organize Medications State: Organize the scattered pill bottles and fill the weekly pill organizer.
4. Clean Up State: Clean up the spilled water, disheveled newspaper, and any other clutter.
5. Assist Elderly State: Provide assistance to the elderly person based on their medication schedule.

Actions:
1. Assess Situation: Check the state of the scattered pill bottles and the weekly pill organizer.
2. Organize Medications: Arrange the pill bottles in an organized manner and fill the weekly pill organizer correctly.
3. Clean Up: Wipe clean any spilled water, tidy up the newspaper, and remove any other clutter.
4. Assist Elderly: Provide the elderly person with the correct medications at the right time.

Based on these states and actions, we can create a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Python code:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'ORGANIZE_MEDICATIONS': self.organize_medications_state,
            'CLEAN_UP': self.clean_up_state,
            'ASSIST_ELDERLY': self.assist_elderly_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Butler Robot initial state. Start with an assessment of the situation.
        self.assess_situation()
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the medication management situation
        if self.is_medication_management_chaotic():
            self.current_state = 'ORGANIZE_MEDICATIONS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CLEAN_UP'

    def organize_medications_state(self):
        # Organize the scattered pill bottles and fill the weekly pill organizer
        self.arrange_pill_bottles()
        self.fill_pill_organizer()
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_UP'

    def clean_up_state(self):
        # Clean up the living area
        self.wipe_spilled_water()
        self.tidy_newspaper()
        self.remove_clutter()
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_ELDERLY'

    def assist_elderly_state(self):
        # Provide assistance to the elderly person based on their medication schedule
        self.provide_medication()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods

    def is_medication_management_chaotic(self):
        # Check if medication management is chaotic based on the scattered pill bottles and incorrectly filled pill organizer
        scattered_bottles = self.checking('scattered pill bottles')
        incorrectly_filled_organizer = self.checking('incorrectly filled pill organizer')
        return scattered_bottles or incorrectly_filled_organizer

    def assess_situation(self):
        # Perform an assessment of the medication management situation
        self.assessing('medication management situation')

    def arrange_pill_bottles(self):
        # Arrange the scattered pill bottles in an organized manner
        self.arranging('scattered pill bottles')

    def fill_pill_organizer(self):
        # Fill the weekly pill organizer correctly
        self.filling('weekly pill organizer')

    def wipe_spilled_water(self):
        # Wipe clean the spilled water
        self.wiping('spilled water')

    def tidy_newspaper(self):
        # Tidy up the disheveled newspaper
        self.tidying('disheveled newspaper')

    def remove_clutter(self):
        # Remove any other clutter in the living area
        self.removing('clutter')

    def provide_medication(self):
        # Provide the elderly person with the correct medications at the right time
        self.serving('elderly person')

    # Run the FSM loop

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()


# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This FSM will guide the Butler Robot to assess the medication management situation, organize the medications if needed, clean up the living area, and assist the elderly person with their medications. The FSM will continue to loop and perform these actions as required.
