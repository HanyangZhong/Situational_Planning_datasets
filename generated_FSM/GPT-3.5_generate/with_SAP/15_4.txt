To create a finite state machine to handle the given scene, we first need to define the possible states and the actions that will be taken in each state. Here is an example implementation in Python:

```python

class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'FIX_ELECTRICAL_OUTLET': self.fix_electrical_outlet_state,
            'MOVE_PLANT': self.move_plant_state,
            'REMOVE_TOY': self.remove_toy_state,
            'COMPLETE': self.complete_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Assess the situation to determine the next action
        if self.is_electrical_outlet_loose():
            self.current_state = 'FIX_ELECTRICAL_OUTLET'
        elif self.is_plant_toxic():
            self.current_state = 'MOVE_PLANT'
        elif self.is_toy_choking_hazard():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_TOY'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'COMPLETE'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Check if the electrical outlet is loose
        self.check_electrical_outlet()

        # Check if the plant is toxic
        self.check_plant_toxicity()

        # Check if there is a choking hazard toy
        self.check_choking_hazard_toy()

        # Move to the next state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def fix_electrical_outlet_state(self):
        # Take the necessary actions to fix the electrical outlet
        self.turn_off_power()
        self.tighten_outlet_cover()

        # Move to the next state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def move_plant_state(self):
        # Take the necessary actions to move the toxic plant
        self.lift_plant()
        self.place_plant_out_of_reach()

        # Move to the next state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def remove_toy_state(self):
        # Take the necessary actions to remove the choking hazard toy
        self.pick_up_toy()
        self.move_toy_to_safe_location()

        # Move to the next state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def complete_state(self):
        # The robot has completed all necessary actions
        pass

    # Actions
    def is_electrical_outlet_loose(self):
        # Check if the electrical outlet is loose
        return self.checking('electrical outlet')

    def is_plant_toxic(self):
        # Check if the plant is toxic
        return self.checking('plant toxicity')

    def is_toy_choking_hazard(self):
        # Check if the toy is a choking hazard
        return self.checking('choking hazard toy')

    def check_electrical_outlet(self):
        # Perform the necessary checks on the electrical outlet
        self.checking('electrical outlet')

    def check_plant_toxicity(self):
        # Perform the necessary checks on the plant toxicity
        self.checking('plant toxicity')

    def check_choking_hazard_toy(self):
        # Perform the necessary checks on the choking hazard toy
        self.checking('choking hazard toy')

    def turn_off_power(self):
        # Turn off the power to the electrical outlet
        self.turning_off('power')

    def tighten_outlet_cover(self):
        # Tighten the cover of the electrical outlet
        self.tightening('outlet cover')

    def lift_plant(self):
        # Lift the plant from its current location
        self.lifting('plant')

    def place_plant_out_of_reach(self):
        # Place the plant out of reach of the cat
        self.placing('plant', 'out of reach')

    def pick_up_toy(self):
        # Pick up the choking hazard toy
        self.picking_up('choking hazard toy')

    def move_toy_to_safe_location(self):
        # Move the toy to a safe location
        self.moving('choking hazard toy', 'safe location')

    def checking(self, item):
        # Perform a check on an item
        pass

    def turning_off(self, item):
        # Turn off an item
        pass

    def tightening(self, item):
        # Tighten an item
        pass

    def lifting(self, item):
        # Lift an item
        pass

    def placing(self, item, location):
        # Place an item to a location
        pass

    def picking_up(self, item):
        # Pick up an item
        pass

    def moving(self, item, location):
        # Move an item to a location
        pass

    def run(self):
        # Run the FSM loop
        while self.current_state != 'COMPLETE':
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, we define the initial state as the 'INITIAL' state, where the robot assesses the situation and determines the next action based on the conditions. The robot then transitions to the appropriate state to fix the electrical outlet, move the toxic plant, or remove the choking hazard toy. Finally, when all the necessary actions have been completed, the robot transitions to the 'COMPLETE' state.

Each state is represented by a function that performs the required actions and updates the current state accordingly. The actions themselves are represented by placeholder functions.

Note: The actions in the FSM logic have been represented by dummy functions for the sake of providing a complete example. In a real-world application, these functions would need to be implemented with the actual code to perform the actions.
