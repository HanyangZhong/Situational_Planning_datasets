Based on the provided information, here is an HFSM implementation in Python code for the butler robot in the given scene:

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_DISTRESS': self.assess_distress_state,

        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):

        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_DISTRESS'

    def assess_distress_state(self):
        # Check if the person is in distress
        if self.is_person_in_distress():
            # Move to reach device state
            self.current_state = 'REACH_DEVICE'
        else:
            # No distress, continue monitoring
            self.current_state = 'CHECK_EMERGENCY'

    def reach_device_state(self):
        # Reach the emergency device
        self.reach('emergency device')
        # Move to take device state
        self.current_state = 'TAKE_DEVICE'

    def take_device_state(self):
        # Grip the emergency device
        self.grip('emergency device')
        # Move to assist person state
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_PERSON'

    def assist_person_state(self):
        # Assist the person by giving them the emergency device

            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            # No emergency, continue monitoring
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_DISTRESS'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for help
        self.call_for_help()
        # Move back to initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Annotation methods
    def is_person_in_distress(self):
        if self.monitoring('person', 'distress'):
            return True
        return False

    def reach(self, object_name):
        # Perform the reach action for the specified object
        print(f"Reaching {object_name}...")

    def is_emergency(self):

        return False

    def call_for_help(self):

        print("Calling for help...")

    def monitoring(self, object_name, condition):
        # Perform monitoring for the specified object and condition
        # Return True or False based on the monitoring result
        return False

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()


# Create an instance of the HFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

Please note that the annotation methods (e.g., `reach`, `grip`, `assist`, `monitoring`, `call_for_help`) are just placeholders for the actual implementation of the actions and monitoring functionalities. You should replace them with the appropriate actions and monitoring logic based on the capabilities of the butler robot.
