Python code for a butler robot FSM in the kitchen scenario:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_DANGER': self.assess_danger_state,
            'REACH_OUT': self.reach_out_state,
            'STOP_REACHING': self.stop_reaching_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Butler Robot initial state. Assess the danger in the kitchen.
        if self.is_pot_boiling():
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_DANGER'
        else:
            print("No danger present in the kitchen.")
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def assess_danger_state(self):
        # Assess the danger level and decide the appropriate action
        if self.is_child_reaching():
            self.current_state = 'REACH_OUT'
        else:
            print("Child not reaching towards the pot.")
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def reach_out_state(self):
        # Signal the child to stop reaching out towards the pot
        print("Butler Robot reaches out and gently stops the child.")
        self.current_state = 'STOP_REACHING'

    def stop_reaching_state(self):
        # Confirm that the child has stopped reaching out
        if self.is_child_reaching():
            print("Child still reaching. Continue monitoring.")
            self.current_state = 'STOP_REACHING'
        else:
            print("Child has stopped reaching. Danger averted.")
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the danger is not resolved
        print("Danger is not being resolved. Butler Robot calls for help.")
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_pot_boiling(self):
        # Check if the pot on the stove is boiling
        return True  # Assume the pot is boiling for the demonstration

    def is_child_reaching(self):
        # Check if the child is reaching towards the pot
        return True  # Assume the child is reaching for the demonstration

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

The FSM for the butler robot in this scenario has four states:
- `INITIAL`: This is the initial state where the robot assesses the danger in the kitchen.
- `ASSESS_DANGER`: In this state, the robot assesses the danger level by checking if the pot is boiling and if the child is reaching towards it.
- `REACH_OUT`: If the child is reaching towards the pot, the robot reaches out and gently stops the child.
- `STOP_REACHING`: Once the robot has reached out, it confirms whether the child has stopped reaching. If the child is still reaching, it continues monitoring; otherwise, it considers the danger averted.
- `CALL_FOR_HELP`: If the danger is not resolved, the robot calls for human assistance.

The FSM is implemented as a loop, where the current state determines which function is called. The actions or annotations are implemented as separate methods within the FSM class.
