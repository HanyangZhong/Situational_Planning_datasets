The scenario described involves a butler robot observing a child playing near an uncovered electrical outlet with a metal toy, posing a significant risk. Based on the given information, the goal of the butler robot should be to ensure the safety of the child by preventing them from reaching the electrical outlet and potentially getting harmed.

To achieve this, we can design a finite state machine (FSM) with the following states:

1. Initial State: The starting point of the FSM. In this state, the butler robot will assess the situation and determine the appropriate action to take.
2. Assess Situation State: This state involves analyzing the surroundings to check if the child is near the electrical outlet and if it's accessible. Depending on the assessment, the FSM will transition to either the "Cover Outlet" state or "Monitor Play" state.
3. Cover Outlet State: If the assessment determines that the child is near the electrical outlet, the FSM will initiate the action to cover the outlet and provide a reminder to the child about the danger.
4. Monitor Play State: In this state, the butler robot will continuously monitor the child's play. If the child gets closer to the outlet, the FSM will transition to the "Engage Child" state. If there's a safety risk, it will transition to the "Call for Help" state.
5. Engage Child State: If the child gets closer to the outlet, the butler robot will engage the child by offering alternative safe activities or toys to divert their attention from the outlet. After engaging the child, the FSM will transition back to the "Monitor Play" state.
6. Call for Help State: If there's a safety risk or the child ignores the robot's warnings or engagement, the butler robot will initiate a call for human assistance to ensure the child's safety.

Below is an implementation of the FSM in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'COVER_OUTLET': self.cover_outlet_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Butler Robot initial state. Start with an assessment.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if the child is near the electrical outlet
        if self.is_child_near_outlet() and self.is_outlet_accessible():
            self.current_state = 'COVER_OUTLET'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def cover_outlet_state(self):
        # Cover the electrical outlet and remind the child about the danger
        self.cover_outlet()
        self.remind_child_of_danger()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child's play. If they get closer to the outlet, engage the child. If there's a safety risk, call for help.
        if self.is_child_near_outlet():
            self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'
        elif self.is_safety_risk():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage the child by providing alternative safe activities or toys
        self.offer_safe_activities()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the child is not responding to warnings or engagement
        self.call_for_human_assistance()

    # Actions / Annotation methods

    def is_child_near_outlet(self):
        # Check if the child is close to the electrical outlet
        # Assume there's a function named "is_child_near_outlet" that returns a boolean value
        child_near_outlet = is_child_near_outlet()
        return child_near_outlet

    def is_outlet_accessible(self):
        # Check if the electrical outlet is accessible by the child
        # Assume there's a function named "is_outlet_accessible" that returns a boolean value
        outlet_accessible = is_outlet_accessible()
        return outlet_accessible

    def cover_outlet(self):
        # Cover the electrical outlet to prevent access by the child
        # Assume there's a function named "cover_outlet" that performs the required actions
        cover_outlet()

    def remind_child_of_danger(self):
        # Provide a reminder to the child about the danger of the electrical outlet
        # Assume there's a function named "remind_child_of_danger" that performs the required actions
        remind_child_of_danger()

    def is_safety_risk(self):
        # Check if there's a safety risk present
        # Assume there's a function named "is_safety_risk" that returns a boolean value
        safety_risk = is_safety_risk()
        return safety_risk

    def offer_safe_activities(self):
        # Offer alternative safe activities or toys to divert the child's attention from the outlet
        # Assume there's a function named "offer_safe_activities" that performs the required actions
        offer_safe_activities()

    def call_for_human_assistance(self):
        # Call for human assistance to ensure the child's safety
        # Assume there's a function named "call_for_human_assistance" that performs the required actions
        call_for_human_assistance()

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()


# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

Note that the actual implementation of the actions (annotated as comments) will depend on the specific capabilities of the butler robot and the methods available to perform the required actions. You will need to replace the placeholder actions with the appropriate code specific to your implementation.
