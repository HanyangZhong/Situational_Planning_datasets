Based on the evaluation feedback, here is a regenerated finite state machine that addresses the areas of improvement:

This regenerated finite state machine includes a new state, 'VERIFY_HAZARD_ELIMINATION', to explicitly check if all hazards have been eliminated before transitioning to the next appropriate state. The 'clean_spills_state' has also been added to address the need for a specific state for cleaning up spills. Additionally, the 'clean_up_state' transition now leads to the 'VERIFY_HAZARD_ELIMINATION' state to ensure that hazards are checked and verified after clean-up.

These updates aim to improve state coverage and transition coverage, as well as to address the cyclomatic complexity by separating out cleaning up spills into a dedicated state. The safety mindset is improved by explicitly verifying hazard elimination. The scalability of the FSM is still improved by separating high-level states. However, the assistance UX and the action set alignment remain similar to the original FSM.
