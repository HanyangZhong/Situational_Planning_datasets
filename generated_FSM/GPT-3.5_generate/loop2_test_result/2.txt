To create a better finite state machine (FSM) based on the provided feedback and scenario, we can make some enhancements to the existing model. Here's an improved FSM for the Butler Robot:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'CLEANUP': self.cleanup_state,
            'MONITOR': self.monitor_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Assessment of the situation
        if self.is_spill_significant():
            self.current_state = 'CLEANUP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR'

    def cleanup_state(self):
        # Cleaning up the spilled liquid
        self.wipe_spill()
        self.dispose_cleaning_material()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR'

    def monitor_state(self):
        # Continuous monitoring for potential risks or hazards
        if self.is_floor_wet():
            self.current_state = 'CLEANUP'
        elif self.is_help_needed():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.call_for_assistance()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR'

    # Actions / Annotation Methods
    def is_spill_significant(self):
        spill_significant = self.checking('spill')
        return spill_significant

    def wipe_spill(self):
        self.wiping('spill')

    def dispose_cleaning_material(self):
        self.dispensing('used cleaning material')

    def is_floor_wet(self):
        floor_wet = self.checking('floor wetness')
        return floor_wet

    def is_help_needed(self):
        help_needed = self.checking('help needed')
        return help_needed

    def call_for_assistance(self):
        self.call('human assistance')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the Butler Robot FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this improved FSM:

1. Added "CALL_FOR_HELP" State:
   - Purpose: This state is introduced to call for human assistance when necessary, considering the presence of pets and the complexity of the situation.
   - Actions: It calls for human assistance when help is needed.
   - Transition: After calling for help, the FSM transitions back to the MONITOR state.

2. Enhanced "MONITOR" State:
   - Purpose: This state not only monitors the floor but also checks if human assistance is needed.
   - Actions: It checks for wet floors and the need for help.
   - Transitions:
     - If the floor is still wet, it transitions back to the CLEANUP state.
     - If human assistance is needed, it transitions to the CALL_FOR_HELP state.
     - If there are no immediate risks or assistance needed, it transitions back to the INITIAL state.

These enhancements improve the FSM's coverage and safety considerations, ensuring that the Butler Robot can handle a wider range of scenarios and call for help when required. The FSM's action set aligns closely with the defined vocabulary, maintaining clarity and consistency.
