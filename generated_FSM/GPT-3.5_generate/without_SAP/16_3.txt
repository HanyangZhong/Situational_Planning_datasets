```

The FSM logic of the butler robot in this kitchen scene is implemented using a class called `ButlerRobotFSM`. The states are defined as strings and stored in the `states` attribute of the class. Each state is associated with a method that represents the actions to be taken in that state.

The FSM loop is implemented in the `run` method which runs indefinitely. The current state is checked and the corresponding state method is called. The state methods update the `current_state` attribute based on the logic and perform the necessary actions specific to that state.

The actions in the code are represented as placeholder print statements. In a real implementation, these actions would be replaced with the actual actions performed by the butler robot to ensure the safety of the child, such as placing toys, moving the child away from the sharp objects, or calling for human assistance.
