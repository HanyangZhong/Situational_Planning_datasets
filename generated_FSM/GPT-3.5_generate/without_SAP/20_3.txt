In this FSM implementation, the states are as follows:
1. `INITIAL`: The initial state where the butler robot assesses the situation.
2. `ASSESS_SITUATION`: The butler robot assesses if the elderly person needs assistance and if the emergency device is reachable.
3. `REACH_EMERGENCY`: If the elderly person needs assistance and the emergency device is not reachable, the butler robot moves towards the emergency device.
4. `ASSIST_ELDERLY`: The butler robot provides assistance to the elderly person.
5. `CALL_FOR_HELP`: The butler robot calls for human assistance.
6. `READY_TO_HELP`: The butler robot waits for human assistance to arrive.
7. `COMPLETE`: Task is completed.

The actions/annotation methods are used to represent the specific tasks or actions performed by the butler robot in each state.
