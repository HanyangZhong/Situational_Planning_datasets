Below is an example of how the given scene can be turned into a finite state machine in Python code:

```
class ButlerRobotFSM():

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'PRESSURE_CHILD': self.pressure_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # The initial state of the FSM
    def initial_state(self):
        print("Butler Robot is initializing...")
        # Assess the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    # Assess the situation in the living room
    def assess_situation_state(self):
        print("Butler Robot is assessing the situation...")
        if self.is_dangerous():
            # Engage and pressure the child to stop
            self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'
        else:
            # Monitor the child's play
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    # Engage the child and try to stop them from reaching the outlet
    def engage_child_state(self):
        print("Butler Robot is engaging the child...")
        if self.is_dangerous():
            self.pressure_child()
        else:
            print("Child has stopped trying to reach the outlet.")
            # Return to monitoring the child's play
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    # Pressure the child to stop them from reaching the outlet
    def pressure_child_state(self):
        print("Butler Robot is putting pressure on the child...")
        if not self.is_dangerous():
            print("Child has stopped trying to reach the outlet.")
            # Return to monitoring the child's play
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    # Monitor the child's play and check for any dangerous behavior
    def monitor_play_state(self):
        print("Butler Robot is monitoring the child's play...")
        if self.is_dangerous():
            # Engage and pressure the child to stop
            self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'
        elif self.is_help_needed():
            # Call for help if necessary
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            # Continue monitoring the child's play
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    # Call for human assistance
    def call_for_help_state(self):
        print("Butler Robot is calling for help...")
        print("Human assistance is required.")
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Check if the child is reaching towards the outlet
    def is_dangerous(self):
        return True

    # Check if help is needed from a human
    def is_help_needed(self):
        return False

    # Run the FSM
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()


# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot_fsm = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot_fsm.run()
```

This code represents a basic FSM structure that assesses the situation, engages the child if necessary, monitors the child's play, and calls for help if needed. The actions mentioned in the scene (e.g., reaching, gripping, reminding) are not included in this example code as they were not explicitly specified in the FSM logic.
