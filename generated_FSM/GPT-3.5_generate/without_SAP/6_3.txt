Below is an implementation of a finite state machine (FSM) that represents the steps a butler robot should take in the given scenario. The FSM is implemented as a class called `LaundryRoomAssistant` with various methods representing the states and actions. Each state is represented as a method and the transitions between states are determined based on certain conditions. The FSM is driven by a `run()` method that runs the FSM loop.

```python
class LaundryRoomAssistant:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS': self.assess_state,
            'CLEANUP': self.cleanup_state,
            'PREVENT_ACCESS': self.prevent_access_state,
            'ALERT': self.alert_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Check the current state of the laundry room
        if self.is_messy():
            self.current_state = 'CLEANUP'
        elif self.is_unsafe():
            self.current_state = 'PREVENT_ACCESS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS'

    def assess_state(self):
        # Assess the situation and determine the next action
        if self.is_messy():
            self.current_state = 'CLEANUP'
        elif self.is_unsafe():
            self.current_state = 'PREVENT_ACCESS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ALERT'

    def cleanup_state(self):
        # Proceed with cleaning up the mess
        self.pickup_spilled_items()
        self.mop_floor()
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS'

    def prevent_access_state(self):
        # Take measures to prevent access to the hazardous items
        self.close_door()
        self.place hazardous_items_out_of_reach()
        self.current_state = 'ALERT'

    def alert_state(self):
        # Stay vigilant and monitor for any potential hazards
        if self.is_unsafe():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for assistance
        self.call_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_messy(self):
        # Check if the laundry room is messy
        messy = self.checking('laundry room cleanliness')
        return messy

    def is_unsafe(self):
        # Check if the laundry room is unsafe
        unsafe = self.checking('safety hazards')
        return unsafe

    def pickup_spilled_items(self):
        # Clean up the spilled items
        self.scooping('spilled items')
        self.disposing('spilled items')

    def mop_floor(self):
        # Mop the floor
        self.mopping('floor')

    def close_door(self):
        # Close the laundry room door
        self.closing('door')

    def place_hazardous_items_out_of_reach(self):
        # Place hazardous items out of reach
        self.lowering('hazardous items')
        self.placing('hazardous items', 'higher shelves')

    def call_for_help(self):
        # Call for assistance
        self.calling('for help')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
laundry_room_assistant = LaundryRoomAssistant()
laundry_room_assistant.run()
```

Note: The code provided is a template and the specific actions for each state would need to be implemented accordingly using the proper syntax and methods for the hardware and software interfaces available to the butler robot.
