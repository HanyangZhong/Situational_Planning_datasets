Here is a finite state machine in Python code for a butler robot assisting a person in a wheelchair who is facing an obstacle in a home study:

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_OBSTACLE': self.assess_obstacle_state,
            'MOVE_OBSTACLE': self.move_obstacle_state,
            'CLEAR_PATH': self.clear_path_state,
            'REACH_DESK': self.reach_desk_state,
            'COMPLETE_TASK': self.complete_task_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Start by assessing the obstacle
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_OBSTACLE'

    def assess_obstacle_state(self):
        # Check if the office chair is blocking the path
        if self.is_obstacle_present():
            self.current_state = 'MOVE_OBSTACLE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CLEAR_PATH'
    
    def move_obstacle_state(self):
        # Move the office chair out of the way
        self.reaching('office chair')
        self.gripping('office chair')
        self.dragging('office chair', 'to the side')
        self.placing_down('office chair')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAR_PATH'
    
    def clear_path_state(self):
        # Path is clear, now help the person reach the desk
        self.current_state = 'REACH_DESK'
    
    def reach_desk_state(self):
        # Assist the person in reaching the desk
        self.reaching('desk')
        self.gripping('desk')
        self.transporting('desk', 'to the person')
        self.releasing('desk')
        self.current_state = 'COMPLETE_TASK'
    
    def complete_task_state(self):
        # Task is complete, waits for further instructions
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_obstacle_present(self):
        return self.checking('office chair')
    
    def reaching(self, target):
        print(f'Reaching {target}')
    
    def gripping(self, target):
        print(f'Gripping {target}')
    
    def dragging(self, target, destination):
        print(f'Dragging {target} {destination}')
    
    def placing_down(self, target):
        print(f'Placing down {target}')
    
    def transporting(self, target, destination):
        print(f'Transporting {target} {destination}')
    
    def releasing(self, target):
        print(f'Releasing {target}')
    
    def checking(self, item):
        print(f'Checking {item}')
        return True

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the HFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, the butler robot's role is to assess the obstacle, move it if necessary, clear the path, assist the person in reaching the desk, and complete the task. Each state represents a specific action or condition, and the butler robot transitions between states based on the current situation. The actions are represented by helper methods such as `reaching`, `gripping`, `dragging`, etc.

Note: The specific actions in the code are just placeholders and will need to be replaced with the actual actions performed by the butler robot, such as moving the office chair or assisting the person in reaching the desk.
