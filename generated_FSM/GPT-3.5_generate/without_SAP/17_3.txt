In this FSM, the butler robot's states are as follows:

- `INITIAL`: The initial state of the butler robot. It starts with assessing the situation.
- `ASSESS_SITUATION`: The butler robot assesses if the staircase lacks a safety gate and if the child is near the edge of the stairs. If a safety gate is present, it goes to the `MONITOR_CHILD` state. If not, it moves to the `GET_SAFETY_GATE` state.
- `GET_SAFETY_GATE`: The butler robot gets the safety gate for the staircase. It opens the closet, reaches for the safety gate, and takes it. Once done, it moves to the `PLACE_SAFETY_GATE` state.
- `PLACE_SAFETY_GATE`: The butler robot places the safety gate at the top of the staircase to protect the child. It positions the safety gate and installs it. Then it closes the closet and goes back to the `MONITOR_CHILD` state.
- `MONITOR_CHILD`: The butler robot continuously monitors the child's proximity to the staircase. If the child is near the stairs, it calls for help and goes to the `CALL_FOR_HELP` state. Otherwise, it goes back to the `INITIAL` state.
- `CALL_FOR_HELP`: The butler robot calls for human assistance to ensure the child's safety. Once done, it goes back to the `INITIAL` state.

The actions/annotation methods in the FSM represent the specific tasks/actions that the butler robot performs in each state. They include actions like checking, reaching, grasping, placing down, and calling for help.

Please note that the actions in the code are placeholders and should be replaced with the appropriate actions based on the specific capabilities and functionalities of the butler robot.
