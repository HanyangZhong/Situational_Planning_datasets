The given finite state machine (FSM) in the Python code is for a butler robot that is responsible for ensuring the safety of pets in the kitchen. However, the FSM provided is for a different scenario related to a pool. 

To create a FSM for the given scene in the kitchen with a curious cat and toxic foods on the counter, we need to define the states and actions specific to this scenario. Here is an FSM designed for the given scene:

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_CAT_DISTANCE': self.assess_cat_distance_state,
            'ENGAGE_CAT': self.engage_cat_state,
            'REMOVE_TOXIC_FOODS': self.remove_toxic_foods_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Initial state: Start with assessing the distance between the cat and the counter
    def initial_state(self):
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_CAT_DISTANCE'

    # Assess the distance between the cat and the counter
    def assess_cat_distance_state(self):
        if self.is_cat_near_counter():
            self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CAT'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Engage the cat and prevent it from jumping onto the counter
    def engage_cat_state(self):
        self.distract_cat()
        if self.is_cat_distracted():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_TOXIC_FOODS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    # Remove the toxic foods from the counter
    def remove_toxic_foods_state(self):
        self.remove_toxic_foods()
        if self.are_toxic_foods_removed():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    # Call for help if the situation cannot be resolved
    def call_for_help_state(self):
        self.call_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_cat_near_counter(self):
        # Check if the cat is near the counter
        cat_near_counter = self.checking('cat', 'counter')
        return cat_near_counter

    def distract_cat(self):
        # Distract the cat to prevent it from jumping onto the counter
        self.distracting('cat')

    def is_cat_distracted(self):
        # Check if the cat is distracted
        cat_distracted = self.monitoring('cat', 'distraction')
        return cat_distracted

    def remove_toxic_foods(self):
        # Remove the toxic foods from the counter
        self.removing('toxic foods', 'counter')

    def are_toxic_foods_removed(self):
        # Check if the toxic foods are removed from the counter
        toxic_foods_removed = self.checking('toxic foods', 'counter')
        return toxic_foods_removed

    def call_for_help(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.calling('human assistance')

    # Run the HFSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()  

# Create an instance of the HFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

Note: The actions methods such as `checking`, `distracting`, `monitoring`, `removing`, and `calling` are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the codebase as placeholder actions.

This FSM will go through the states of assessing the distance, engaging the cat, removing toxic foods, and calling for help if necessary. The robot will continuously loop over the states until a termination condition is met.
