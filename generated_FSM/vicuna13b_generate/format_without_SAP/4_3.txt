Here's an example implementation of a butler robot to handle the scenario:
```python
class ButlerRobot(FSM):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.current_state = 'idle'
        self.butler = ButterKnife()

    def idle(self):
        """
        Idle state.
        """
        pass

    def detect_danger(self):
        """
        Check for dangerous situations in the environment.
        """
        if self.butler.check_danger():
            self.send_command('alert')

    def alert(self):
        """
        Alert state.
        """
        pass

    def take_action(self):
        """
        Take action to mitigate the danger.
        """
        if self.butler.is_danger_close():
            self.send_command('sweep')
        elif self.butler.is_ingredient_on_fire():
            self.send_command('put_out_fire')

    def sweep(self):
        """
        Sweep state.
        """
        pass

    def put_out_fire(self):
        """
        Put out fire state.
        """
        pass

    def respond_to_alert(self):
        """
        Respond to alert by switching to the take_action state.
        """
        self.send_command('take_action')

    def respond_to_sweep(self):
        """
        Respond to sweep by switching to the take_action state.
        """
        self.send_command('take_action')

    def respond_to_put_out_fire(self):
        """
        Respond to put_out_fire by switching to the take_action state.
        """
        self.send_command('take_action')

    def run(self):
        """
        Run the state machine loop.
        """
        while True:
            self.current_state = self.current_state
            if self.current_state == 'idle':
                self.detect_danger()
            elif self.current_state == 'alert':
                self.respond_to_alert()
            elif self.current_state == 'sweep':
                self.respond_to_sweep()
            elif self.current_state == 'put_out_fire':
                self.respond_to_put_out_fire()
```
This implementation defines several states: `idle`, `alert`, `sweep`, and `put_out_fire`. The `idle` state does nothing, while the `alert` state checks for dangerous situations and sends a command to switch to the `take_action` state if necessary. The `sweep` and `put_out_fire` states are for cleaning up after a fire and putting out the flames, respectively.

The `respond_to_*` methods are used to transition between the states. For example, the `respond_to_alert` method transitions from the `alert` state to the `take_action` state when an alert is received.

The `run` method is the state machine loop, which repeats until the robot is turned off.
