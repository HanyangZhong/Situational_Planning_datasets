Here is a simplified implementation of a butler robot that can help the person in the wheelchair to navigate through the room and reach the desk:
```python
class ButlerRobot(FSMRobot):
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = 'idle'
        self.desired_state = 'help_person'

    def idle(self):
        self.update_status("Idle")

    def help_person(self):
        self.update_status("Assisting person")
        # check if person is ready to be assisted
        if self.check_if_person_is_ready():
            self.update_status("Assisting person")
            # move the office chair to the side
            self.move_obstacle()
            # transport the person to the desk
            self.transport_person_to_desk()
            # assist the person in reaching for objects on the desk
            self.assist_person_in_reaching_objects()
            # return to idle state
            self.update_status("Idle")
        else:
            # if the person is not ready, wait
            self.update_status("Waiting for person to be ready")

    def move_obstacle(self):
        # reach for the office chair using the gripping action
        self.grip_chair()
        # lift and lower the chair to move it out of the way
        self.lift_lower_chair()
        # turn the chair so that it is facing the side
        self.turn_chair()

    def transport_person_to_desk(self):
        # reach for the wheelchair using the gripping action
        self.grip_wheelchair()
        # lift and lower the wheelchair to pick it up
        self.lift_lower_wheelchair()
        # transport the wheelchair to the desk
        self.transport_wheelchair_to_desk()
        # place the wheelchair down on the desk
        self.place_wheelchair_down()

    def assist_person_in_reaching_objects(self):
        # use the gripping action to pick up objects on the desk
        self.grip_objects()
        # transport the objects to the person in the wheelchair
        self.transport_objects_to_person()
        # use the placing down action to place the objects in the person's reach
        self.place_objects_down()

    def grip_chair(self):
        # use the reaching action to grasp the office chair
        pass

    def lift_lower_chair(self):
        # use the lifting action to raise the office chair
        pass

    def turn_chair(self):
        # use the rotating action to turn the office chair
        pass

    def grip_wheelchair(self):
        # use the reaching action to grasp the wheelchair
        pass

    def lift_lower_wheelchair(self):
        # use the lifting action to raise the wheelchair
        pass

    def transport_wheelchair_to_desk(self):
        # use the transporting action to move the wheelchair to the desk
        pass

    def place_wheelchair_down(self):
        # use the placing down action to set the wheelchair down on the desk
        pass

    def grip_objects(self):
        # use the reaching action to grasp objects on the desk
        pass

    def transport_objects_to_person(self):
        # use the transporting action to move the objects to the person in the wheelchair
        pass

    def place_objects_down(self):
        # use the placing down action to place the objects in the person's reach
        pass

    def update_status(self, status):
        # print the current state of the robot
        print(f"{status}")

    def check_if_person_is_ready(self):
        # check if the person is ready to be assisted
        # return True if the person is ready, False otherwise
        return True
```
This implementation defines a `ButlerRobot` class that inherits from the `FSMRobot` class. The `FSMRobot` class is a finite state machine that defines the states and transitions between them.

The `ButlerRobot` class has an `idle` state that does nothing, a `help_person` state that assists the person in the wheelchair to navigate through the room and reach the desk, and helper methods for each action taken in the `help_person` state.

The `help_person` state checks if the person is ready to be assisted, moves the office chair out of the way, transports the person to the desk, and assists the person in reaching for objects on the desk. It then returns to the `idle` state.

The helper methods are abstract and don't need actual implementation. The `update_status` method is used to print the current
