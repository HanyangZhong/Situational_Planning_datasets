Here's an example of a butler robot class in Python that handles medication management chaos:
```python
class MedicationManagementButler(FSM):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.current_state = 'idle'
        self.attributes = {'water_spill': False, 'newspaper_disheveled': False}
        self.helper_methods = {'reaching': None, 'lifting': None, 'checking': None, 'opening': None, 'closing': None, 'reminding': None}

    def idle(self):
        if self.attributes['water_spill']:
            self.helper_methods['wiping']()
        if self.attributes['newspaper_disheveled']:
            self.helper_methods['folding']()
        self.current_state = 'scan_area'

    def scan_area(self):
        all_bottles_empty = True
        for bottle in self.attributes['bottles']:
            if bottle['caps_on']:
                all_bottles_empty = False
        if not all_bottles_empty:
            self.helper_methods['transporting'](bottles=self.attributes['bottles'], organizer=self.attributes['organizer'])
            self.current_state = 'sort_bottles'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'scan_organizer'

    def sort_bottles(self):
        sorted_bottles = sorted(self.attributes['bottles'], key=lambda x: x['type'])
        for bottle in sorted_bottles:
            if bottle['caps_on']:
                self.attributes['organizer'].add_bottle(bottle)
        self.current_state = 'load_organizer'

    def load_organizer(self):
        self.attributes['organizer'].sort_bottles()
        self.helper_methods['unloading']()
        self.current_state = 'schedule_reminders'

    def schedule_reminders(self):
        self.helper_methods['reminding']()
        self.current_state = 'idle'

    def check_states(self):
        if self.attributes['water_spill']:
            self.helper_methods['sweeping']()
        if self.attributes['newspaper_disheveled']:
            self.helper_methods['folding']()

    def state_transition(self, next_state):
        if self.current_state == 'idle' and next_state != 'idle':
            self.current_state = next_state
        elif self.current_state == next_state:
            self.current_state = 'idle'

    def process_action(self, action):
        if action in self.helper_methods:
            self.helper_methods[action]()
```
This class models a butler robot responsible for managing medication in a small living area. The robot has a set of initial states, including 'idle', 'scan\_area', 'sort\_bottles', 'load\_organizer', and 'schedule\_reminders'. When in these states, the robot performs different actions to manage the medication, such as checking for spills and disheveled newspapers, scanning the area for bottles, sorting bottles, loading them into a pill organizer, scheduling reminders, and so on.

The robot has a set of helper methods for performing actions, such as wiping, folding, transporting, opening, closing, reminding, and so on. These helper methods are called when the robot is in certain states and performs the required action.

The robot also has a current\_state attribute that tracks the active state of the robot, and a set of attributes that keep track of the living area state, such as the presence of a water spill or a disheveled newspaper.

Finally, this class has a run() method that executes the state machine loop, calling the appropriate state methods based on the current state and any action received.
