Attributes
----------

* `current_state`: str
* `last_state`: str
* `action_sequence`: list of tuples

Methods
-------

** State Transitions **
```python
def check_transitions(self):
    # check for state transitions
    # if a transition is allowed, call state transition method
    pass

def do_action(self, action):
    # perform the action
    pass

def handle_event(self, event):
    # handle the event
    pass

def transition(self, target_state):
    # transition to the target state
    pass
```
** Initialization **
```python
def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.current_state = 'idle'
    self.last_state = ''
    self.action_sequence = []
```
** State Actions **
```python
def get_action(self, action_name):
    # get the action from the action_sequence list
    pass

def add_action(self, action):
    # add an action to the action_sequence list
    pass

def remove_action(self, action):
    # remove an action from the action_sequence list
    pass
```
** Helper Methods **
```python
def sweep_floor(self):
    # sweep the floor
    pass

def wipe_counter(self):
    # wipe the counter
    pass

def respond(self, message):
    # respond to the message
    pass

def monitor(self):
    # monitor the environment
    pass
```
** Run **
```python
def run(self):
    # main state machine loop
    pass
```
Note: This is just a basic implementation of the state machine. You may need to add more states, actions, and helper methods based on the specific requirements.
