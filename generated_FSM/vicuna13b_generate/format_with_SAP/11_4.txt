Here is a possible implementation of the butler robot finite state machine in Python:
```python
class Butler(FSM):
    def __init__(self, bedroom):
        super().__init__()
        self.bedroom = bedroom
        self.current_state = 'idle'
        self.is_help_required = False

    def idle(self):
        if self.check_if_help_required():
            self.move_to_help_required_state()

    def help_required(self):
        self.current_state = 'reaching'
        self.perform_reaching_action()

    def reaching(self):
        if self.check_if_reaching_action_successful():
            self.move_to_next_state()
        else:
            self.move_to_help_required_state()

    def next_state(self):
        # determine the next state based on the current context and task
        self.current_state = 'lifting'
        self.perform_lifting_action()

    def lifting(self):
        if self.check_if_lifting_action_successful():
            self.move_to_next_state()
        else:
            self.move_to_help_required_state()

    def next_state(self):
        # determine the next state based on the current context and task
        self.current_state = 'transporting'
        self.perform_transporting_action()

    def transporting(self):
        if self.check_if_transporting_action_successful():
            self.move_to_next_state()
        else:
            self.move_to_help_required_state()

    def next_state(self):
        # determine the next state based on the current context and task
        self.current_state = 'finished'
        self.perform_finished_action()

    def finished(self):
        self.current_state = 'idle'

    def check_if_help_required(self):
        # check if help is required based on the current context and task
        return False

    def move_to_help_required_state(self):
        self.current_state = 'help_required'

    def perform_reaching_action(self):
        # perform the reaching action based on the current context and task
        pass

    def check_if_reaching_action_successful(self):
        # check if the reaching action was successful
        return False

    def perform_lifting_action(self):
        # perform the lifting action based on the current context and task
        pass

    def check_if_lifting_action_successful(self):
        # check if the lifting action was successful
        return False

    def perform_transporting_action(self):
        # perform the transporting action based on the current context and task
        pass

    def check_if_transporting_action_successful(self):
        # check if the transporting action was successful
        return False

    def perform_finished_action(self):
        # perform the finished action based on the current context and task
        pass

    def is_state_valid(self, state):
        # check if the state is valid based on the current context and task
        return False
```
This implementation defines the `Butler` class that inherits from the `FSM` class. The `idle` method is the initial state, which checks if help is required and transitions to the `help_required` state if needed. The `help_required` state performs a reaching action to pick up the medicine bottle, which may transition to the `reaching` state if a reaching action is required. The `reaching` state checks if the reaching action was successful and transitions to the `next_state` if successful or to the `help_required` state if not. The `next_state` method determines the next state based on the current context and task, and performs the required action. The `finished` method marks the end of the task and transitions back to the `idle` state. The helper methods are abstract and do not have actual implementation. The `is_state
