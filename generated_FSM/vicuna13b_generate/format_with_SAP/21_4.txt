Here's a Python class definition for the butler robot:
```python
class ButlerRobot(FSMRobot):
    """
    A class modeling a butler robot with a finite state machine for managing its behavior.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize the butler robot with necessary attributes.
        """
        self.current_state = 'idle'
        self.state_actions = {
            'idle': [],
            'reaching': ['reaching'],
            'lifting': ['lifting'],
            'transporting': ['transporting'],
            'lower': ['lowering'],
            'wiping': ['wiping'],
            'reminding': ['reminding'],
            'helping': ['helping']
        }

    def run(self):
        """

        while True:

            self.perform_actions()

    def handle_event(self):
        """

        pass

    def update_state(self):

    def perform_actions(self):
        """

        pass

    def go_to_state(self, state):

```
This class definition outlines the high-level structure of a finite state machine for a butler robot. You can add more specific methods and attributes inside each state method to implement the actual behavior.
