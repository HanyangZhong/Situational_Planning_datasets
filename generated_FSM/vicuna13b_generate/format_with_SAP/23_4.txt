Here's a possible implementation of the finite state machine for the butler robot in the given scenario:
```python
class ChildAndDogStateMachine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = 'idle'

    def idle(self):
        # do nothing

    def detect_danger(self):
        # check for potential hazards and determine if action is needed

    def initiate_action(self):
        # initiate appropriate action based on current state

    def execute_action(self):
        # execute the chosen action

    def transition(self, new_state):
        self.current_state = new_state

    def is_safe(self):
        # check if the child and dog are safe
        # return True if safe, False otherwise

    def check_conditions(self):
        # check conditions for transitions between states

    def run(self):
        while True:
            state_actions = []

            if self.current_state == 'idle':
                state_actions = self.initiate_action()
            elif self.current_state == 'detect_danger':
                state_actions = self.detect_danger()
            elif self.current_state in ['initiate_action', 'execute_action']:
                state_actions = self.execute_action()
            elif self.current_state == 'transition':
                state_actions = self.transition(self.check_conditions())
            elif self.current_state == 'is_safe':
                state_actions = self.is_safe()

            self.transition(state_actions[-1])

# Example usage:
butler = ChildAndDogStateMachine()
butler.run()
```
In this implementation, the finite state machine has six states: 'idle', 'detect\_danger', 'initiate\_action', 'execute\_action', 'transition', and 'is\_safe'. The 'idle' state does nothing, while the 'detect\_danger' state checks for potential hazards and determines if action is needed. The 'initiate\_action' and 'execute\_action' states initiate and execute appropriate actions based on the current state. The 'transition' state transitions to the appropriate new state based on the result of checking conditions for transitions between states. Finally, the 'is\_safe' state checks if the child and dog are safe and returns True if safe, False otherwise.

The 'run' method of the state machine repeatedly executes the chosen actions and transitions to the appropriate new state based on the actions that were performed. The state machine checks for dangerous situations and takes the appropriate action to ensure the safety of the child and the dog.
