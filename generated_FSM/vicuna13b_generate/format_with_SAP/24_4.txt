Here is a possible implementation of the finite state machine for the butler robot in the given scenario:
```python
class ButlerFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = 'idle'
        
    def idle(self):
        # Do nothing
        pass
    
    def detect_choking_hazard(self):
        # Check for choking hazards and take appropriate action
        pass
    
    def reach_for_toy(self):
        # Reach for the toy and assess the situation
        pass
    
    def lift_toy(self):
        # Lift the toy and move it out of the child's reach
        pass
    
    def place_toy_down(self):
        # Place the toy back on the floor within the child's reach
        pass
    
    def monitor_child(self):
        # Monitor the child and the toys to prevent choking hazards
        pass
    
    def transition(self, new_state):
        # Transition to the new state
        pass
    
    def check_conditions(self):
        # Check for any potential choking hazards and take appropriate action
        pass
```
The `ButlerFSM` class contains the high-level state machine logic and transitions. The `current_state` attribute tracks the active state, and each state has a corresponding method that defines the actions to be taken in that state.

The `idle` state does nothing, while the `detect_choking_hazard` state checks for choking hazards and takes appropriate action. The `reach_for_toy`, `lift_toy`, and `place_toy_down` states handle the specific actions of reaching for, lifting, and placing back down a toy. The `monitor_child` state continuously monitors the child and the toys to prevent choking hazards.

The `transition` method handles state transitions based on conditions and actions. The `check_conditions` method checks for any potential choking hazards and takes appropriate action.

This implementation can be expanded and modified as needed to model more complex behavior.
