Here is a possible implementation of the butler robot finite state machine in Python:
```ruby
class ButlerRobot(FSMRobot):
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = 'idle'
        self.states = {
            'idle': {
                'action': None,
                'conditions': [],
            },
            'scanning': {
                'action': self.scan,
                'conditions': [
                    'all pill bottles are accounted for',
                    'weekly pill organizer is correctly filled',
                    'living area is free of clutter',
                ],
            },
            'organizing': {
                'action': self.organize,
                'conditions': [
                    'pill bottles are organized by type and dosage',
                    'weekly pill organizer is correctly filled',
                    'living area is free of clutter',
                ],
            },
            'reminding': {
                'action': self.remind,
                'conditions': [
                    'medication schedule is correctly followed',
                    'no missed doses',
                ],
            },
        }

    def current_state(self):
        return self.current_state

    def set_current_state(self, state):
        self.current_state = state

    def can_transition(self, state):
        return state in self.states and self.states[self.current_state]['conditions'] == self.states[state]['conditions']

    def do_transition(self, state):
        self.set_current_state(state)
        self.states[self.current_state]['action']()

    def scan(self):
        # scan the room for pill bottles and other objects
        # and identify any missing or misplaced items
        pass

    def organize(self):
        # organize pill bottles and weekly pill organizer
        # according to a predetermined system or algorithm
        pass

    def remind(self):
        # remind the user to take their medication at the correct times
        pass

    def check_conditions(self):
        # check the current state of the room and user
        # and determine if any conditions for state transitions are met
        pass

    def get_input(self):
        # get input from sensors or user interface
        pass

    def execute_action(self, action):
        # execute the specified action using the robot's capabilities
        pass

    def is_finished(self):
        # determine if the current task is finished
        # and transition to a new state if necessary
        pass

    def run(self):
        while True:
            state = self.current_state()
            if not self.can_transition(state):
                continue
            self.do_transition(state)
            if self.is_finished():
                break
```
This implementation defines a `ButlerRobot` class that inherits from the `FSMRobot` class (a custom class that provides the FSM logic). The `ButlerRobot` class has an `idle` state that does nothing, as well as three other states: `scanning`, `organizing`, and `reminding`.

The `scanning` state checks the current state of the room and user to see if any conditions for state transitions are met. The `organizing` state organizes the pill bottles and weekly pill organizer according to a predetermined system or algorithm. The `reminding` state reminds the user to take their medication at the correct times.

The `check_conditions` method checks the current state of the room and user to see if any conditions for state transitions are met. The `get_input` method gets input from sensors or user interface. The `execute_action` method executes the specified action using the robot's capabilities. The `is_finished` method determines if the current task is finished, and transitions to a new state if necessary.

The `run` method executes the state machine loop, repeatedly checking the current state and transitioning to a new state if necessary.

Note that this implementation is
