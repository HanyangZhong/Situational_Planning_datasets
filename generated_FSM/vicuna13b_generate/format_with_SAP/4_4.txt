Here's an example of a Python class definition that models a butler robot with a finite state machine:
```python
class ButlerRobot(FSM):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.current_state = 'idle'

    def initialize_state(self):
        self.current_state = 'idle'

    def idle(self):
        pass

    def detect_risk(self):
        pass

    def prioritize(self):
        pass

    def take_action(self):
        pass

    def transition(self, new_state):
        self.current_state = new_state
```
This class inherits from the `FSM` class, which is a custom class that we can define to represent the finite state machine. The `__init__` method initializes the robot's current state to 'idle', and the `initialize_state` method can be used to set the initial state of the robot to 'idle' during its initialization.

The `idle` state is a placeholder method that the robot can implement to do nothing when it is not in any other state. Similarly, the `detect_risk`, `prioritize`, and `take_action` methods are also placeholder methods that the robot can implement to perform the corresponding actions.

The `transition` method is used to change the robot's current state to a new state. The `new_state` parameter is passed to the method to indicate the new state that the robot should transition to.

To use this class, we can create a new instance of the `ButlerRobot` class and call its methods as needed. Here's an example of how we can use this class to model the behavior of the butler robot:
```python
# Create a new instance of the ButlerRobot class
robot = ButlerRobot()

# Set the initial state to 'idle'
robot.initialize_state()

# Loop through the state machine
while True:
    robot.transition(robot.current_state)
```
This code creates a new instance of the `ButlerRobot` class and sets its initial state to 'idle'. It then enters a loop where it calls the `transition` method of the robot to switch between different states. The robot can implement the methods for each state to perform the corresponding actions.
