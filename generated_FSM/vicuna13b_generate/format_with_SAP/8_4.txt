(KitchenRobot)FSM(StateMachine)

This class represents a kitchen robot that can take actions to address hazards and maintain a clean and safe environment. The robot is designed to follow a finite state machine (FSM) to make decisions on what actions to take based on its current state and the current context.

The class has the following attributes:

* current\_state: an integer representing the current state of the robot
* states: a list of tuples representing the states and their corresponding methods
* helper\_methods: a dictionary of helper methods for each state

The class has the following methods:

* \_\_init\_\_(): initializes the robot's attributes
* run(): executes the state machine loop
* go\_to\_state(state): sets the current\_state to the given state
* handle\_state(): the main method for handling the current state

The states are defined as follows:

* READING:
	+ action: READING
	+ helper\_methods:
		- check\_knife\_danger(): checks if the knife drawer is hazardous and sets the current\_state accordingly
		- none
* PLACING\_OBJECTS\_AWAY:
	+ action: PLACING\_OBJECTS\_AWAY
	+ helper\_methods:
		- reach\_knives(): reaches into the drawer and grasps the knives, one by one
		- place\_knives\_away(): places the knives into the designated safe storage location
		- none
* CLEANING\_UP:
	+ action: CLEANING\_UP
	+ helper\_methods:
		- wipe\_countertop(): wipes the countertop with a damp cloth
		- none
* REMINDING:
	+ action: REMINDING
	+ helper\_methods:
		- none
* RESPONDING\_TO\_INPUT:
	+ action: RESPONDING\_TO\_INPUT
	+ helper\_methods:
		- none
