Sure, here's a similar hierarchical finite state machine (HFSM) for the scenario you provided.

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CALM_THE_DOG': self.calm_the_dog_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # The initial state. Start by assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the playing situation of the child and the dog
        if self.is_play_too_rough():
            self.current_state = 'CALM_THE_DOG'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def calm_the_dog_state(self):
        # If the dog and the child's play is too rough, try to calm the dog down.
        self.attract_dog_attention()
        self.remind_child_of_safety()
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage the child in a more safe game.
        self.collect_toys()
        self.offer_safe_game_to_child()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child and the dog's play. If they play rough again, calm the dog.
        if self.is_play_too_rough():
            self.current_state = 'CALM_THE_DOG'
        elif self.is_safety_risk():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the dog's energy is too high or if the child is ignoring the robot.
        self.call_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_play_too_rough(self):
        play_too_rough = self.monitoring('child and dog', 'play')
        return play_too_rough

    def attract_dog_attention(self):
        self.grasping('safe dog toy')
        self.shaking('safe dog toy')

    def remind_child_of_safety(self):
        self.reminding('child', 'safety rules')

    def collect_toys(self):
        self.gathering('child toys')

    def offer_safe_game_to_child(self):
        self.delivering('safe game', 'child')

    def is_safety_risk(self):
        safety_risk = self.checking('room', 'safety risk')
        return safety_risk

    def call_for_help(self):
        self.calling('human assistance')

    # Run the HFSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()


# Create an instance of the HFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```
In this Python script, I've defined a class for the butler robot which is organized as a Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM). In particular, the robot begins with an initial state where it assesses the situation. Based on the assessment, it transitions into other states as a response to different conditions. The robot continuously monitors the child and dog's play. If the play gets too rough, it tries to calm the dog down and if a safety risk is identified, it calls for human assistance.
