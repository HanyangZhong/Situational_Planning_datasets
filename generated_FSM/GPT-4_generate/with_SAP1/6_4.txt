Here is a slightly modified version that includes the household cleaning products on the loose.

```
The program starts by assessing the situation, then cleans up the mess if it detects any, then takes care of the chemicals that are not safely stored away. If it cannot do either of the tasks, then it'll call for help. Once it has done its tasks, it'll keep monitoring the situation and only act accordingly when there are issues it was programmed to address.
