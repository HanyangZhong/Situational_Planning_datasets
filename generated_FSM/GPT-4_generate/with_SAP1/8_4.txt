Here is how your scene can be translated into a Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM):

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_KNIVES': self.secure_knives_state,
            'RESUME_MEAL_PREP': self.resume_meal_prep_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Butler Robot initial state. Start with an assessment.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if the knife drawer is open and the potential risk
        if self.is_drawer_open():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_KNIVES'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'RESUME_MEAL_PREP'
    
    def secure_knives_state(self):
        # If the knife drawer is open, secure the knives for safety.
        self.secure_knives()
        self.current_state = 'RESUME_MEAL_PREP'

    def resume_meal_prep_state(self):
        # Resume the meal preparation that has been interrupted.
        self.resume_cooking()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_drawer_open(self):
        drawer_open = self.checking('drawer_open')
        return drawer_open

    def secure_knives(self):
        self.reaching('for_knife_drawer')
        self.grasping('knife_handle')
        self.releasing('knife_in_safe_position')
        self.closing('knife_drawer')

    def resume_cooking(self):
        self.reaching('for_cutting_board')
        self.grasping('bell_pepper')
        self.placing_down('bell_pepper', 'cutting_board')
        self.cutting('bell_pepper')

    # Run the HFSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]() 


# Create an instance of the HFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, the robot first assesses the situation. If the knife drawer is open, it moves to a state in which it secures the knives by reaching for the knife drawer, grasping each knife, then releasing each knife into a safe position inside the drawer before closing the drawer. If the drawer is not open, or after the robot has secured the knives, it moves to a state in which it continues the meal preparation that was interrupted.

Please note that the above code is a high level representation of what an algorithm may look like. The final implementation will heavily depend on the actual capabilities and interfaces of the robot, which we have not considered here.
