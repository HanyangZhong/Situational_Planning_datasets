Based on the scenario you've provided, we'll design a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot tasked with assisting an elderly person in distress. The FSM will include states and transitions relevant to the given scene. I'll use the verbs you provided for actions the robot can perform.

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REACH_DEVICE': self.reach_device_state,
            'ASSIST_PERSON': self.assist_person_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state
        }
        # Set initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: Start by assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation: check if the elderly person is in distress and needs help
        if self.detects_distress():
            self.current_state = 'REACH_DEVICE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def reach_device_state(self):
        # Reach for the emergency response device
        self.grasping('emergency device')
        self.lowering('emergency device', 'to reachable height')
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_PERSON'

    def assist_person_state(self):
        # Assist the elderly person
        if self.needs_physical_assistance():
            self.supporting_person()
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for additional help if required
        self.calling_for_help('medical assistance')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation and reassess as needed
        if self.detects_change():
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    # Helper methods for actions and conditions
    def detects_distress(self):
        # Check for signs of distress in the elderly person
        return self.monitoring('elderly person', 'signs of distress')

    def needs_physical_assistance(self):
        # Determine if physical assistance is needed
        return self.checking('elderly person', 'need for physical assistance')

    def supporting_person(self):
        # Provide physical support to the elderly person
        self.grasping('elderly person')
        self.supporting('elderly person', 'to a safer position')

    def calling_for_help(self, assistance_type):
        # Call for medical or other assistance
        self.calling(assistance_type)

    def detects_change(self):
        # Detect any changes in the elderly person's condition or environment
        return self.monitoring('environment', 'changes')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code defines a finite state machine for a butler robot in a scenario where an elderly person needs assistance. The robot assesses the situation, reaches for an emergency device if needed, assists the person, calls for help if necessary, and continuously monitors the situation. Each state corresponds to a specific action or set of actions, and transitions are based on the assessment of the situation and the needs of the elderly person.
