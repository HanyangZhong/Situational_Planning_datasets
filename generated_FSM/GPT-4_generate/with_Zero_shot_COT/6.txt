To design a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot addressing the described laundry room scene, we need to identify the key tasks and dangers in the scene and how the robot would logically progress through them. Based on the scenario, the primary concerns are the uncapped bleach bottle, the tipped-over detergent, and ensuring the area is safe, especially for pets or children.

Let's construct an FSM that handles these tasks:

1. **Initial State**: The robot starts in this state, preparing to assess the situation.
2. **Assess Situation**: The robot assesses the room for any immediate hazards.
3. **Secure Hazardous Items**: The robot takes steps to secure any hazardous items like uncapped bottles.
4. **Clean Spill**: If there's a spill, the robot cleans it up.
5. **Return Items**: The robot returns items to their proper place.
6. **Final Check**: The robot performs a final safety check.
7. **Idle**: The robot goes into an idle state, waiting for further instructions or periodically monitoring the room.

Here is the Python code implementing this FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_HAZARDOUS_ITEMS': self.secure_hazardous_items_state,
            'CLEAN_SPILL': self.clean_spill_state,
            'RETURN_ITEMS': self.return_items_state,
            'FINAL_CHECK': self.final_check_state,
            'IDLE': self.idle_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Transition to the situation assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Check for any immediate hazards like open bottles or spills
        if self.hazard_detected():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_HAZARDOUS_ITEMS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'IDLE'

    def secure_hazardous_items_state(self):
        # Secure any hazardous items like uncapped bottles
        self.capping('bleach bottle')
        self.standing_up('tipped detergent')
        if self.spill_detected():
            self.current_state = 'CLEAN_SPILL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'RETURN_ITEMS'

    def clean_spill_state(self):
        # Clean up any spills
        self.wiping('spilled detergent')
        self.current_state = 'RETURN_ITEMS'

    def return_items_state(self):
        # Return items to their proper place
        self.placing_down('cleaning products', 'shelves')
        self.current_state = 'FINAL_CHECK'

    def final_check_state(self):
        # Perform a final safety check
        self.checking('room safety')
        self.current_state = 'IDLE'

    def idle_state(self):
        # Wait for further instructions or periodically monitor
        self.monitoring('laundry room')

    # Helper methods for actions
    def hazard_detected(self):
        return True  # Example logic; replace with actual sensing logic

    def spill_detected(self):
        return True  # Example logic; replace with actual sensing logic

    def capping(self, item):
        # Example method for capping a bottle
        pass

    def standing_up(self, item):
        # Example method for standing up a tipped item
        pass

    def wiping(self, spill):
        # Example method for cleaning a spill
        pass

    def placing_down(self, item, location):
        # Example method for placing down an item
        pass

    def checking(self, context):
        # Example method for checking safety
        pass

    def monitoring(self, room):
        # Example method for monitoring a room
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Instantiate and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code sets up a basic FSM for the butler robot, with each state corresponding to a step in addressing the messy laundry room. Each helper method (`capping`, `wiping`, etc.) would contain the actual implementation of the robot's actions. The FSM loops continuously, allowing the robot to react to changes in the environment.
