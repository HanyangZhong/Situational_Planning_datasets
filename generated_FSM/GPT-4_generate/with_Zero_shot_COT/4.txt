To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described kitchen scenario, we'll follow the steps to address the situation effectively and safely. We'll use the provided verbs to define actions in each state. Here's the Python code for the FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'TURN_OFF_STOVE': self.turn_off_stove_state,
            'REMOVE_HAZARDS': self.remove_hazards_state,
            'IMPROVE_VENTILATION': self.improve_ventilation_state,
            'CHECK_ENVIRONMENT': self.check_environment_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'IDLE': self.idle_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # The initial state to start the situation assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the kitchen for any immediate dangers
        if self.detect_flame_and_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'TURN_OFF_STOVE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'IDLE'

    def turn_off_stove_state(self):
        # Safely turn off the stove
        self.turning('stove knob', 'off')
        self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'

    def remove_hazards_state(self):
        # Remove any hazardous items away from the stove
        self.grasping('oil bottle')
        self.placing_down('oil bottle', 'safe place')
        self.grasping('dish towel')
        self.hanging('dish towel', 'safe place')
        self.current_state = 'IMPROVE_VENTILATION'

    def improve_ventilation_state(self):
        # Improve ventilation in the kitchen
        self.opening('window')
        self.turning('extractor fan', 'on')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_ENVIRONMENT'

    def check_environment_state(self):
        # Check if the environment is safe
        if self.is_environment_safe():
            self.current_state = 'IDLE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance in case of unresolved issues
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'IDLE'

    def idle_state(self):
        # Idle state, waiting for further instructions or monitoring
        self.monitoring('kitchen')

    # Helper functions for state actions
    def detect_flame_and_hazards(self):
        # Detects if there is an unattended flame and nearby hazards
        # Simulated detection logic
        return True

    def is_environment_safe(self):
        # Checks if the environment is now safe
        # Simulated safety check logic
        return True

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Simulates calling for help
        print("Calling for human assistance.")

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the Butler Robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code defines a series of states that the robot can be in, with transitions between them based on the situation in the kitchen. Each state corresponds to an action or a set of actions that the robot should perform to ensure safety. The helper functions are placeholders for the actual implementation of sensing and acting methods. The `run` method keeps the FSM running, continuously checking and reacting to the kitchen's state.
