To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot handling the described kitchen scenario, we'll define states that correspond to the tasks that need to be addressed in the kitchen. These tasks include dealing with the spill, ensuring safety (especially because of the presence of a pet), and restoring order. We'll use the verbs you provided to define actions in each state. Here's an outline of the FSM:

1. **Initial State**: Start with assessing the situation.
2. **Assess Situation**: Check the extent of the spill and potential hazards.
3. **Secure Area**: Ensure the area around the spill is safe, especially for the pet.
4. **Clean Spill**: Address the spill by cleaning it up.
5. **Restore Order**: Put things back in place, like the olive oil bottle.
6. **Final Check**: Ensure everything is safe and tidy before finishing.

Now, let's implement this FSM in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_AREA': self.secure_area_state,
            'CLEAN_SPILL': self.clean_spill_state,
            'RESTORE_ORDER': self.restore_order_state,
            'FINAL_CHECK': self.final_check_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: Start with an assessment of the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the spill and any immediate hazards
        if self.is_spill_large():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_AREA'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CLEAN_SPILL'

    def secure_area_state(self):
        # Ensure the area is safe, especially for pets
        self.removing('pet from area')
        self.placing_down('warning sign')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_SPILL'

    def clean_spill_state(self):
        # Address the spill by cleaning it
        self.collecting('cleaning supplies')
        self.mopping('spill')
        self.current_state = 'RESTORE_ORDER'

    def restore_order_state(self):
        # Put things back in place and address the source of the spill
        self.placing_down('olive oil bottle')
        self.turning_off('stove')
        self.current_state = 'FINAL_CHECK'

    def final_check_state(self):
        # Final check to ensure safety and order
        self.checking('kitchen safety')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Helper methods
    def is_spill_large(self):
        # Check if the spill is large enough to require area securing
        return True  # This would be determined by some sensor data in a real robot

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code provides a basic structure for the FSM. In a real-world application, the methods like `is_spill_large()` would involve sensor data analysis to make decisions. Also, the `run` method is an infinite loop for demonstration purposes, but in practice, this would be managed differently, potentially with event-driven triggers.
