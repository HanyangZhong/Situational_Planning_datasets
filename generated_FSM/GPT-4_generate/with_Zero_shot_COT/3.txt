To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described scenario, we will define states and transitions that are appropriate for addressing the potential fire hazard posed by the lit candle in the study room. Here's how we can structure it:

1. **Initial State**: The robot starts in this state.
2. **Assess Situation**: The robot assesses the situation in the room.
3. **Extinguish Candle**: If the candle poses a fire hazard, the robot takes steps to extinguish it safely.
4. **Clean Up**: After dealing with the candle, the robot cleans up any wax spills or other messes.
5. **Monitor Room**: Return to a monitoring state to ensure safety is maintained.
6. **Call for Help**: If the situation is beyond the robot's capabilities, it calls for human assistance.

Now, let's implement this in Python code:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'EXTINGUISH_CANDLE': self.extinguish_candle_state,
            'CLEAN_UP': self.clean_up_state,
            'MONITOR_ROOM': self.monitor_room_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state. Transition to assess the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation for potential hazards.
        if self.is_candle_hazardous():
            self.current_state = 'EXTINGUISH_CANDLE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ROOM'

    def extinguish_candle_state(self):
        # Safely extinguish the candle if it poses a fire hazard.
        self.gripping('candle holder')
        self.releasing('candle flame', 'extinguisher')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_UP'

    def clean_up_state(self):
        # Clean up any wax spills or other messes.
        self.wiping('wax spills')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ROOM'

    def monitor_room_state(self):
        # Monitor the room for any further hazards or actions needed.
        if self.is_situation_still_hazardous():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation cannot be handled by the robot.
        self.calling_for_help('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods to simulate actions
    def is_candle_hazardous(self):
        # Check if the candle poses a hazard
        return True  # Placeholder for actual sensing logic

    def is_situation_still_hazardous(self):
        # Check if the situation is still hazardous
        return False  # Placeholder for actual sensing logic

    def calling_for_help(self, assistance_type):
        # Placeholder for calling for help
        pass

    def gripping(self, item):
        # Placeholder for gripping action
        pass

    def releasing(self, item, tool):
        # Placeholder for releasing action
        pass

    def wiping(self, item):
        # Placeholder for wiping action
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, each state represents a stage in the robot's decision-making process. The robot starts in the `INITIAL` state, assesses the situation, and transitions through different states based on its assessment of the environment. Each state includes actions that the robot would perform, represented by placeholder methods like `gripping`, `releasing`, and `wiping`. The actual implementation of these methods would depend on the robot's hardware and sensing capabilities.
