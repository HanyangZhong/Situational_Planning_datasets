To design a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the given living room scene, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify States**: We'll define states based on the situation and actions the robot needs to take.
2. **Define Transitions**: Transitions between states will be based on the assessment of the situation.
3. **Implement Actions**: Actions corresponding to each state will be chosen from the provided verbs list.

Here's an example of how this FSM could be implemented in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define states in the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CALM_DOWN_DOG': self.calm_down_dog_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state of the robot. Begin with situation assessment.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the play between the child and the dog
        if self.is_play_too_rough():
            self.current_state = 'CALM_DOWN_DOG'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def calm_down_dog_state(self):
        # Calm down the dog if the play is too rough
        self.monitoring('dog', 'excitement level')
        self.responding('calm commands', 'dog')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage the child to ensure safety
        self.collecting('safe toys')
        self.delivering('safe toys', 'child')
        self.reminding('child', 'safe play')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the play. If play becomes rough, engage again.
        if self.is_play_too_rough():
            self.current_state = 'CALM_DOWN_DOG'
        elif self.is_emergency():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance in case of emergency.
        self.calling('human help')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action / Monitoring methods
    def is_play_too_rough(self):
        # Check if the play between the child and the dog is too rough
        return self.monitoring('child and dog', 'play intensity')

    def is_emergency(self):
        # Check for any emergency situation
        return self.monitoring('room', 'emergency')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this implementation:
- **States**: The robot transitions through various states based on the situation assessment.
- **Transitions**: Transitions depend on whether the play is too rough, or if there's an emergency.
- **Actions**: Actions like monitoring, responding, reminding, and calling for help are executed as per the situation.

Remember, this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, these functions would involve complex logic to interact with the robot's sensors and actuators.
