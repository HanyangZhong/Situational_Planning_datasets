To create a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a Butler Robot responding to the scenario where a pregnant woman has fallen in the kitchen, we can define states and transitions based on the verbs provided. The FSM will outline the steps the robot should take in this emergency situation. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Assess Situation**: The robot first needs to assess the situation to understand the emergency and the needs of the person.
2. **Call for Help**: If the situation is beyond the robot's capability to handle alone, it should immediately call for human assistance.
3. **Approach Woman**: The robot needs to safely approach the woman without causing further harm.
4. **Reaching Alert Button**: The robot should attempt to reach the emergency alert system button.
5. **Assist Woman**: Depending on the robot's capabilities, it should try to provide physical support to the woman.

Here's how the FSM can be implemented in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'APPROACH_WOMAN': self.approach_woman_state,
            'REACH_ALERT_BUTTON': self.reach_alert_button_state,
            'ASSIST_WOMAN': self.assist_woman_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state of the robot. Start by assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation to understand the emergency
        if self.is_situation_critical():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'APPROACH_WOMAN'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance in critical situations
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def approach_woman_state(self):
        # Safely approach the woman
        self.approaching('woman')
        self.current_state = 'REACH_ALERT_BUTTON'

    def reach_alert_button_state(self):
        # Attempt to reach the emergency alert button
        if self.can_reach_button():
            self.pressing('alert button')
            self.current_state = 'ASSIST_WOMAN'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def assist_woman_state(self):
        # Assist the woman based on the robot's capabilities
        self.assisting('woman')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods
    def is_situation_critical(self):
        # Check if the situation is critical
        return self.monitoring('woman', 'condition')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Action to call for human assistance
        self.calling_for_help()

    def approaching(self, target):
        # Action to approach a target safely
        self.moving_towards(target)

    def can_reach_button(self):
        # Check if the robot can reach the emergency button
        return self.reaching('alert button')

    def pressing(self, button):
        # Action to press a button
        self.pressing(button)

    def assisting(self, person):
        # Assist the person based on the robot's capabilities
        self.supporting(person)

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code provides a basic structure for the FSM. The actual implementation of actions like `monitoring`, `moving_towards`, `reaching`, `pressing`, and `supporting` would depend on the robot's specific capabilities and sensors.
