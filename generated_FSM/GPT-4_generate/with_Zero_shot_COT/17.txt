To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described scenario, we need to design states that specifically address the situation of a child near an unprotected staircase. The FSM should ensure the child's safety first and foremost. Let's outline the states and their purposes:

1. **Initial State**: Start by assessing the situation.
2. **Assess Situation**: Determine the immediate risk to the child.
3. **Secure Child**: Safely move the child away from the staircase.
4. **Call for Help**: If the situation is beyond the robot's ability to handle safely, call for human assistance.
5. **Monitor Area**: After securing the child, monitor the area to ensure continued safety.

For each state, we'll use verbs from the provided list to define actions. Let's write the Python code for this FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_CHILD': self.secure_child_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'MONITOR_AREA': self.monitor_area_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state, start by assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if the child is in immediate danger
        if self.is_child_near_stairs():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_CHILD'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_AREA'

    def secure_child_state(self):
        # Secure the child away from the stairs
        self.reaching('towards child')
        self.gripping('child gently')
        self.transporting('child', 'safe area')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_AREA'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if needed
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_AREA'

    def monitor_area_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the area for safety
        if self.is_child_near_stairs():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_CHILD'
        elif self.is_assistance_needed():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_AREA'

    # Helper methods for actions and assessments
    def is_child_near_stairs(self):
        # Check if the child is near the stairs
        return self.monitoring('child', 'stairs')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Action to call for help
        self.calling('human assistance')

    def is_assistance_needed(self):
        # Assess if additional assistance is needed
        return self.monitoring('situation', 'need for assistance')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Instantiate and run the Butler Robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, each state is designed to respond to the specific scenario. The robot first assesses the situation, then takes action to secure the child if necessary, calls for help if the situation is beyond its capabilities, and continuously monitors the area for ongoing safety.
