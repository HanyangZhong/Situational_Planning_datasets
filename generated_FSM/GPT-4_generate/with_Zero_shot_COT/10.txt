To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the scenario you described, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Initial Assessment**: The robot needs to assess the situation first.
2. **Clear Path**: The robot should then take actions to clear the path for the wheelchair user.
3. **Ensure Comfort**: After clearing the path, the robot should ensure that the wheelchair user is comfortable and ready to work.
4. **Monitor and Respond**: Finally, the robot should monitor the situation and be ready to respond to any further needs.

We will use the verbs from your provided list for actions. Here's a Python implementation of this FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'CLEAR_PATH': self.clear_path_state,
            'ENSURE_COMFORT': self.ensure_comfort_state,
            'MONITOR_AND_RESPOND': self.monitor_and_respond_state,
            'COMPLETE': self.complete_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: assess the situation and decide next action
        self.current_state = 'CLEAR_PATH'

    def clear_path_state(self):
        # Clear the path by moving the obstructive chair
        self.grasping('office chair')
        self.dragging('office chair', 'to a suitable location')
        self.releasing('office chair')
        self.current_state = 'ENSURE_COMFORT'

    def ensure_comfort_state(self):
        # Ensure the wheelchair user is comfortable and ready to work
        self.assisting('wheelchair user', 'reaching the desk')
        self.arranging('desk items', 'for easy access')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_AND_RESPOND'

    def monitor_and_respond_state(self):
        # Monitor the situation and be ready to respond to further needs
        needs_met = self.checking('wheelchair user', 'needs')
        if needs_met:
            self.current_state = 'COMPLETE'
        else:
            self.responding('to additional needs')

    def complete_state(self):
        # Complete the task
        self.reminding('wheelchair user', 'to call if further assistance needed')
        # Return to initial state or power down

    # Helper methods for actions
    def grasping(self, item):
        # Add logic to grasp an item
        pass

    def dragging(self, item, location):
        # Add logic to drag an item to a location
        pass

    def releasing(self, item):
        # Add logic to release an item
        pass

    def assisting(self, person, task):
        # Add logic to assist a person with a task
        pass

    def arranging(self, items, manner):
        # Add logic to arrange items in a specific manner
        pass

    def checking(self, subject, aspect):
        # Add logic to check a subject for a specific aspect
        # Returns boolean
        return True

    def responding(self, action):
        # Add logic to respond to actions
        pass

    def reminding(self, person, message):
        # Add logic for reminding a person about something
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while self.current_state != 'COMPLETE':
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the Butler Robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, each state corresponds to a specific set of actions the robot should perform. The `run` method keeps the robot in operation until it reaches the 'COMPLETE' state, after which it can return to its initial state or power down, depending on the desired functionality. The helper methods like `grasping`, `dragging`, `assisting`, etc., are placeholders where specific logic for each action can be implemented.
