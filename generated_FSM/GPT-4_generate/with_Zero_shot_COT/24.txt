To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in a scenario where a child is playing with potentially dangerous toys, we will define states and transitions that enable the robot to ensure the child's safety. The FSM will focus on identifying and mitigating choking hazards.

Let's outline the states and transitions:

1. **Initial State**: The robot starts in an observation mode, assessing the environment.
2. **Assess Situation**: The robot observes the child and identifies any potential hazards.
3. **Remove Hazards**: If choking hazards are identified, the robot removes them.
4. **Engage Child**: The robot engages with the child to distract them from hazardous items.
5. **Monitor Play**: Continuously observe the child's play and ensure safety.
6. **Emergency Protocol**: If a choking incident is suspected, initiate emergency procedures.

For each state, we'll use appropriate actions from the provided list, like 'Checking', 'Removing', 'Engaging', etc. Here's the Python code implementing this FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_HAZARDS': self.remove_hazards_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'EMERGENCY_PROTOCOL': self.emergency_protocol_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial observation and assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Check for potential hazards
        if self.finds_hazard():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def remove_hazards_state(self):
        # Remove small items posing choking hazards
        self.removing('hazardous toys')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage the child to keep them away from hazards
        self.engaging('child', 'safe play')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child's play
        if self.detects_emergency():
            self.current_state = 'EMERGENCY_PROTOCOL'
        elif self.finds_hazard():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def emergency_protocol_state(self):
        # Handle any emergency situations
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods
    def finds_hazard(self):
        # Implementation to detect hazards
        return True  # Placeholder for actual hazard detection logic

    def removing(self, item):
        # Implementation to remove an item
        pass  # Placeholder for actual removing action

    def engaging(self, target, activity):
        # Implementation to engage with the child
        pass  # Placeholder for actual engagement action

    def detects_emergency(self):
        # Implementation to detect emergencies
        return False  # Placeholder for actual emergency detection logic

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Implementation for calling for help
        pass  # Placeholder for actual calling action

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code provides a framework for the robot's behavior. Actual implementation details like detecting hazards, engaging the child, and handling emergencies would need sophisticated AI and sensor integration, which are beyond the scope of this code snippet.
