In this scenario, we are tasked with creating a finite state machine (FSM) in Python to handle a situation where a young child is reaching for sharp objects in the kitchen. The FSM will guide the actions of a hypothetical butler robot in this situation. We will use the provided list of verbs for the actions and structure the FSM to ensure the child's safety is the top priority.

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_DANGER': self.remove_danger_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state of the robot, proceed to assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if the child is reaching for dangerous objects
        if self.is_child_reaching_for_danger():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_DANGER'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def remove_danger_state(self):
        # Remove sharp objects from child's reach
        self.grasping('sharp objects')
        self.placing_down('sharp objects', 'out of reach')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage with the child to divert attention
        self.reminding('child', 'kitchen safety')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation for any further danger
        if self.is_situation_safe():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation is beyond robot's handling
        self.calling('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions
    def is_child_reaching_for_danger(self):
        # Check if child is reaching for dangerous objects
        return self.monitoring('child', 'sharp objects')

    def is_situation_safe(self):
        # Monitor if the situation is now safe
        return self.monitoring('kitchen', 'safety')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, the robot initially assesses the situation. If it finds the child reaching for dangerous objects, it proceeds to remove the danger and then engage with the child to educate them about kitchen safety. The robot continuously monitors the situation, and if it deems necessary, it calls for human assistance. This ensures the safety of the child while also addressing the immediate danger posed by the sharp objects.
