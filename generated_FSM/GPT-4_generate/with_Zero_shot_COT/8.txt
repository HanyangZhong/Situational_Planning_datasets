Based on the provided scene and the specified verbs, we can design a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot that safely handles the situation of a disorganized and potentially dangerous knife drawer. The FSM will focus on identifying and mitigating the hazard, ensuring the safety of the environment. Here's a step-by-step implementation in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'ORGANIZE_KNIVES': self.organize_knives_state,
            'CHECK_ENVIRONMENT': self.check_environment_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'COMPLETE': self.complete_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Start with assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the knife drawer situation
        if self.is_drawer_hazardous():
            self.current_state = 'ORGANIZE_KNIVES'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CHECK_ENVIRONMENT'

    def organize_knives_state(self):
        # Reorganize the knives safely
        self.grasping('knife handle')
        self.rearranging('knife', 'safe orientation')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_ENVIRONMENT'

    def check_environment_state(self):
        # Ensure no other hazards are present
        if self.is_environment_safe():
            self.current_state = 'COMPLETE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if necessary
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'COMPLETE'

    def complete_state(self):
        # Task completed
        print("Task Completed Safely.")

    # Helper methods for actions and conditions
    def is_drawer_hazardous(self):
        # Check if the knife drawer is hazardous
        return True  # Assuming it's always true for this scenario

    def rearranging(self, item, orientation):
        # Rearrange the item safely
        print(f"Rearranging {item} to {orientation}.")

    def is_environment_safe(self):
        # Check for other hazards in the environment
        return True  # Assuming it's safe for simplicity

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        print("Calling for human assistance.")

    def grasping(self, item):
        # Grasp an item safely
        print(f"Grasping {item}.")

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while self.current_state != 'COMPLETE':
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, the robot initially assesses the situation. If the knife drawer is hazardous, it proceeds to safely organize the knives. After organizing, it checks for any other hazards in the environment. If necessary, it calls for human help and finally completes the task. Each state uses the given verbs to describe the robot's actions.
