In the scenario described, we can design a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a Butler Robot that aims to ensure the safety of the pregnant woman in the kitchen. The FSM will include states relevant to identifying and mitigating the hazard posed by the open cleaning chemicals. The states are named and defined to reflect the robot's actions in response to the situation. We'll use the verbs from the provided list to define actions within each state.

Here's the Python code for the Butler Robot's FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_CHEMICALS': self.remove_chemicals_state,
            'ENSURE_SAFETY': self.ensure_safety_state,
            'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT': self.monitor_environment_state,
            'COMPLETE_TASK': self.complete_task_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state where the robot starts.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation to identify any hazards.
        hazard_present = self.checking('chemical bottles')
        if hazard_present:
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_CHEMICALS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def remove_chemicals_state(self):
        # Remove the hazardous chemicals from the woman's vicinity.
        self.grasping('chemical bottles')
        self.transporting('chemical bottles', 'safe storage')
        self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def ensure_safety_state(self):
        # Ensure the environment is safe for the woman.
        self.checking('air quality')
        self.ventilating('kitchen')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def monitor_environment_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the environment to ensure ongoing safety.
        safe = self.monitoring('kitchen environment')
        if safe:
            self.current_state = 'COMPLETE_TASK'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def complete_task_state(self):
        # Task completed successfully.
        self.reminding('woman', 'chemical safety')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods
    def checking(self, item):
        # Checks the presence or condition of an item.
        return True  # Simplified for example purposes

    def grasping(self, item):
        # Grasp an item to move it.
        pass  # Implementation details

    def transporting(self, item, location):
        # Transport an item to a specific location.
        pass  # Implementation details

    def ventilating(self, area):
        # Ventilate an area to ensure air quality.
        pass  # Implementation details

    def monitoring(self, area):
        # Monitor an area for safety.
        return True  # Simplified for example purposes

    def reminding(self, person, message):
        # Remind a person about a specific message.
        pass  # Implementation details

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the Butler Robot and run the FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code defines a basic FSM for the Butler Robot, with states corresponding to the assessment and mitigation of the hazard posed by open cleaning chemicals in a kitchen environment. Each state involves actions that use the verbs from the provided list. The `run` method continuously cycles through the states based on the current situation. The action methods (`checking`, `grasping`, etc.) are placeholders and should be implemented with specific logic as required.
