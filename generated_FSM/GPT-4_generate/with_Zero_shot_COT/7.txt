To design a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot dealing with the described scene in a hallway, we will identify the key actions needed to safely and efficiently clear the hallway. The states will be defined based on the sequence of actions the robot needs to take, using the provided verbs. Here's how we can structure it:

1. **Initial State:** The robot starts by assessing the situation.
2. **Assess Situation:** The robot checks the hallway for clutter and identifies items to be cleared.
3. **Clear Pathway:** The robot picks up and arranges items obstructing the hallway.
4. **Safety Check:** The robot ensures that the hallway is safe for walking, and checks for any remaining hazards.
5. **Final State:** The robot completes the task and returns to its initial state.

Each state will involve actions like picking up items, arranging them properly, and ensuring safety. Let's write the Python code for this FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CLEAR_PATHWAY': self.clear_pathway_state,
            'SAFETY_CHECK': self.safety_check_state,
            'FINAL': self.final_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: Start by assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the clutter in the hallway
        clutter_present = self.checking('hallway clutter')
        if clutter_present:
            self.current_state = 'CLEAR_PATHWAY'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'FINAL'

    def clear_pathway_state(self):
        # Clear the hallway by picking up and arranging items
        self.collecting('hallway items')
        self.arranging('items', 'proper places')
        self.current_state = 'SAFETY_CHECK'

    def safety_check_state(self):
        # Ensure the hallway is safe and free from hazards
        is_safe = self.checking('hallway safety')
        if is_safe:
            self.current_state = 'FINAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CLEAR_PATHWAY'

    def final_state(self):
        # Task completed, return to the initial state or standby
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods
    def checking(self, item):
        # Implementation of checking action
        pass

    def collecting(self, items):
        # Implementation of collecting action
        pass

    def arranging(self, items, location):
        # Implementation of arranging action
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while self.current_state != 'FINAL':
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code defines a simple FSM for the butler robot. Each state represents a stage in the process of clearing and securing the hallway. The `checking`, `collecting`, and `arranging` methods are placeholders for the actual implementation of these actions, which would involve the robot's sensors and manipulators. The `run` method continually updates the state based on the situation until the task is completed.
