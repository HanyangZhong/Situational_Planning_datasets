To create a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described scenario, we need to define states that allow the robot to appropriately respond to the situation of a disabled person who has fallen and cannot reach the emergency button. The states should be tailored to the specific actions needed in this context.

I will define the FSM with the following states:
1. **Initial State**: The robot starts here.
2. **Assess Situation**: The robot assesses the situation in the room.
3. **Approach Individual**: The robot moves closer to the individual.
4. **Check for Consciousness and Injuries**: The robot checks if the individual is conscious and for any visible injuries.
5. **Press Emergency Button**: The robot presses the emergency button to call for help.
6. **Aid Individual**: The robot provides aid to the individual, like helping them into a safe position.
7. **Wait for Help**: The robot waits for human assistance to arrive, while monitoring the individual's condition.
8. **Reset to Initial**: Once help has arrived, the robot resets to the initial state for its next task.

Here's how the code would look:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'APPROACH_INDIVIDUAL': self.approach_individual_state,
            'CHECK_CONSCIOUSNESS': self.check_consciousness_state,
            'PRESS_EMERGENCY_BUTTON': self.press_emergency_button_state,
            'AID_INDIVIDUAL': self.aid_individual_state,
            'WAIT_FOR_HELP': self.wait_for_help_state,
            'RESET': self.reset_state
        }
        # Initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state, proceed to assess the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation in the room
        if self.detects_fallen_individual():
            self.current_state = 'APPROACH_INDIVIDUAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'RESET'

    def approach_individual_state(self):
        # Approach the individual
        self.moving_towards('individual')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_CONSCIOUSNESS'

    def check_consciousness_state(self):
        # Check for consciousness and injuries
        if self.is_individual_conscious():
            self.current_state = 'PRESS_EMERGENCY_BUTTON'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'AID_INDIVIDUAL'

    def press_emergency_button_state(self):
        # Press the emergency button
        self.pressing('emergency button')
        self.current_state = 'AID_INDIVIDUAL'

    def aid_individual_state(self):
        # Aid the individual
        self.providing_aid('individual')
        self.current_state = 'WAIT_FOR_HELP'

    def wait_for_help_state(self):
        # Wait for human assistance
        if self.is_help_arrived():
            self.current_state = 'RESET'
        else:
            self.monitoring('individual')

    def reset_state(self):
        # Reset to initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Placeholder methods for actions and checks
    def detects_fallen_individual(self):
        # Check if an individual has fallen
        return True  # Placeholder

    def moving_towards(self, target):
        # Move towards a target
        pass  # Placeholder

    def is_individual_conscious(self):
        # Check if individual is conscious
        return True  # Placeholder

    def pressing(self, target):
        # Press a button or similar
        pass  # Placeholder

    def providing_aid(self, target):
        # Provide aid to an individual
        pass  # Placeholder

    def is_help_arrived(self):
        # Check if help has arrived
        return False  # Placeholder

    def monitoring(self, target):
        # Monitor a situation or individual
        pass  # Placeholder

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code is a basic framework. The actual implementation would require specific methods for detecting conditions, moving, pressing buttons, providing aid, and so on, which would depend on the robot's hardware and software capabilities.
