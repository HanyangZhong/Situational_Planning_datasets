To create a finite state machine (FSM) in Python for a butler robot dealing with the described living room scene, we'll follow the scenario step by step. The scenario involves a young child playing near an uncovered electrical outlet with a metal toy, which poses a risk of electric shock. The FSM will have states corresponding to the actions the robot should take in this situation. Here's how the FSM can be structured:

1. **Initial State**: Assess the situation.
2. **Check Child's Safety**: Verify if the child is in immediate danger.
3. **Intervene if Necessary**: If the child is in danger, intervene to prevent harm.
4. **Ensure Safety**: Make the environment safe, e.g., by covering the outlet.
5. **Monitor Situation**: Continuously monitor the child to ensure safety.
6. **Call for Help**: If the situation escalates beyond the robot's control.

Let's implement this in Python code:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'CHECK_CHILD_SAFETY': self.check_child_safety_state,
            'INTERVENE_IF_NECESSARY': self.intervene_if_necessary_state,
            'ENSURE_SAFETY': self.ensure_safety_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Start with assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_CHILD_SAFETY'

    def check_child_safety_state(self):
        # Check if the child is in immediate danger.
        if self.is_child_in_danger():
            self.current_state = 'INTERVENE_IF_NECESSARY'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def intervene_if_necessary_state(self):
        # Take immediate action to remove the child from danger.
        self.removing('metal toy', 'child')
        self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def ensure_safety_state(self):
        # Ensure the environment is safe, e.g., cover the outlet.
        self.covering('electrical outlet')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child's safety.
        if self.is_child_in_danger():
            self.current_state = 'INTERVENE_IF_NECESSARY'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance in case of an uncontrollable situation.
        self.calling('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action / Annotation methods
    def is_child_in_danger(self):
        # Check if the child is in immediate danger.
        danger = self.monitoring('child', 'electrical outlet')
        return danger

    def removing(self, object, subject):
        # Remove a dangerous object from the child's reach.
        self.grasping(object)
        self.transporting(object, 'away from', subject)

    def covering(self, object):
        # Cover a dangerous object to make it safe.
        self.affixing('safety cover', object)

    def calling(self, assistance_type):
        # Call for assistance.
        self.calling_for_help(assistance_type)

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code sets up a simple FSM for the butler robot to handle the described scenario. Each state represents a step in ensuring the child's safety, and transitions between states are based on the assessment of the situation. The action methods (`removing`, `covering`, `calling`) are placeholders for the robot's actual actions and should be implemented accordingly.
