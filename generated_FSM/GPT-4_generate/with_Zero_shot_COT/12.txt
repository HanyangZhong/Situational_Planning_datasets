To create a finite state machine for a butler robot in the described scenario, we need to define the states and transitions that are appropriate for ensuring the safety and comfort of the pregnant woman in the living room. The FSM will involve states for assessing the situation, clearing hazards, and monitoring the environment. Let's build this step by step.

1. **Initial State**: The robot starts in an initial state where it begins its operations.
2. **Assess Situation**: The robot assesses the living room for potential hazards to the pregnant woman.
3. **Clear Hazards**: If hazards are identified, the robot clears them.
4. **Monitor Environment**: Continuously monitor the environment to ensure safety.
5. **Emergency Response**: In case of any emergency or if the woman needs assistance.
6. **Complete Task**: Once the environment is deemed safe, the robot completes its task.

For the actions, we will use verbs from the provided list that are suitable for the tasks a butler robot might perform in this scenario. Here's the Python code implementing this FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CLEAR_HAZARDS': self.clear_hazards_state,
            'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT': self.monitor_environment_state,
            'EMERGENCY_RESPONSE': self.emergency_response_state,
            'COMPLETE_TASK': self.complete_task_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state. Start with an assessment of the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the room for potential hazards to the pregnant woman
        if self.detect_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'CLEAR_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def clear_hazards_state(self):
        # Clear any identified hazards from the pregnant woman's path
        self.rearranging('furniture')
        self.collecting('toys', 'magazines')
        self.lifting('rug edges')
        self.placing_down('rug edges safely')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def monitor_environment_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the environment for any new hazards or needs of the woman
        if self.detect_emergency():
            self.current_state = 'EMERGENCY_RESPONSE'
        elif self.task_completed():
            self.current_state = 'COMPLETE_TASK'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def emergency_response_state(self):
        # Handle any emergencies or assist the woman if needed
        self.calling_for_help('emergency services')
        self.assisting('pregnant woman')
        self.current_state = 'COMPLETE_TASK'

    def complete_task_state(self):
        # Complete the task and return to the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and conditions
    def detect_hazards(self):
        # Method to detect hazards in the room
        return True  # Placeholder for hazard detection logic

    def detect_emergency(self):
        # Method to detect any emergency situations
        return False  # Placeholder for emergency detection logic

    def task_completed(self):
        # Method to check if the task is completed
        return True  # Placeholder for task completion logic

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while self.current_state != 'COMPLETE_TASK':
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Instantiate and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code sets up a basic FSM for the butler robot. It starts in an initial state, assesses the situation, clears hazards if any, continuously monitors the environment, and responds to emergencies. The methods for detecting hazards, emergencies, and task completion are placeholders and would be implemented with appropriate logic in a real-world application.
