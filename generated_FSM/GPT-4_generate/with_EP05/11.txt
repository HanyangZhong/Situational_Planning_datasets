Based on the scenario provided, the finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot assisting a person suffering from a headache would involve a series of states and transitions that enable the robot to efficiently and safely assist the person. The FSM will be designed to handle this specific situation, focusing on assessing the person's condition, retrieving the medicine, and ensuring the person's comfort.

Here's an example FSM implementation in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'RETRIEVE_MEDICINE': self.retrieve_medicine_state,
            'ASSIST_PERSON': self.assist_person_state,
            'MONITOR_PERSON': self.monitor_person_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state. Begin with assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the person's condition and the medicine's location
        if self.is_person_in_need() and self.is_medicine_nearby():
            self.current_state = 'RETRIEVE_MEDICINE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def retrieve_medicine_state(self):
        # Retrieve the medicine from the bedside table
        self.reaching('medicine')
        self.grasping('medicine bottle')
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_PERSON'

    def assist_person_state(self):
        # Assist the person by giving them the medicine
        self.delivering('medicine', 'person')
        self.monitoring('person', 'reaction to medicine')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PERSON'

    def monitor_person_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the person's condition
        if self.is_person_stable():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the person's condition worsens or does not improve
        self.calling_for_help('medical emergency')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods
    def is_person_in_need(self):
        # Check if the person is in need
        return self.monitoring('person', 'need for assistance')

    def is_medicine_nearby(self):
        # Check if the medicine is within reach
        return self.checking('medicine', 'proximity')

    def is_person_stable(self):
        # Check if the person's condition is stable
        return self.monitoring('person', 'condition')

    def calling_for_help(self, reason):
        # Call for help
        self.calling('emergency services', reason)

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, each state represents a specific step in the process of aiding the person with a headache, and transitions are based on the assessment of the person's needs and the robot's actions. The actions used are from the provided list, like 'reaching', 'grasping', 'monitoring', and 'calling for help'. The helper methods (`is_person_in_need`, `is_medicine_nearby`, etc.) represent hypothetical checks or sensor readings that the robot might perform.
