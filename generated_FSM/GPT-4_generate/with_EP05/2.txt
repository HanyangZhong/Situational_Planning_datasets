To design a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described kitchen scenario, I will structure the FSM to address the situation in a logical and safe manner. The scenario involves a wet and slippery floor due to a spill of water and olive oil, as well as other aspects such as the presence of a pet, indicated by the dog bowl. The FSM will be tailored to ensure safety and cleanliness, using the given list of actions.

Here's the Python code for the FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_AREA': self.secure_area_state,
            'CLEAN_SPILL': self.clean_spill_state,
            'CHECK_POT': self.check_pot_state,
            'FINALIZE': self.finalize_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state, start by assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the spill and any immediate hazards
        if self.is_spill_large():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_AREA'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def secure_area_state(self):
        # Secure the area to prevent accidents
        self.reminding('pets and humans', 'to stay away')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_SPILL'

    def clean_spill_state(self):
        # Clean the spill effectively
        self.grasping('mop')
        self.mixing('cleaning solution')
        self.mopping('spilled area')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_POT'

    def check_pot_state(self):
        # Ensure the pot on the stove is safe
        self.checking('pot')
        if self.is_pot_safe():
            self.current_state = 'FINALIZE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def finalize_state(self):
        # Final checks and cleanup
        self.arranging('kitchen utensils')
        self.placing_down('mop')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if necessary
        self.calling('human help')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for conditions and actions
    def is_spill_large(self):
        # Check if the spill is large enough to require cleaning
        return True  # Placeholder for actual condition check

    def is_pot_safe(self):
        # Check if the pot on the stove is safe
        return True  # Placeholder for actual condition check

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code creates an FSM with states tailored to the kitchen scenario, including assessing the situation, securing the area, cleaning the spill, checking the pot, finalizing the cleanup, and calling for help if necessary. The robot transitions between these states based on the conditions of the environment and the tasks to be performed. The helper methods `is_spill_large` and `is_pot_safe` are placeholders for actual condition checks that would be implemented in a real-world scenario.
