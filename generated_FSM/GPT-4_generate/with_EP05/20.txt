In order to create a finite state machine (FSM) in Python for a butler robot that responds to the given scenario, we'll follow a similar structure to the example you provided, but tailor the states and actions to the specific scene described.

The scene involves an elderly person in distress who cannot reach an emergency response device. The robot's actions will focus on assessing the situation, providing immediate assistance, and ensuring the person's safety by retrieving and activating the emergency device.

Here's an implementation of such an FSM in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'PROVIDE_ASSISTANCE': self.provide_assistance_state,
            'RETRIEVE_DEVICE': self.retrieve_device_state,
            'ACTIVATE_DEVICE': self.activate_device_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Butler Robot's initial state: start with an assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the elderly person's condition and needs
        if self.is_person_in_distress():
            self.current_state = 'PROVIDE_ASSISTANCE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def provide_assistance_state(self):
        # Provide immediate assistance to the person
        self.assisting('elderly person')
        # Check if emergency device is needed
        if self.is_emergency_device_needed():
            self.current_state = 'RETRIEVE_DEVICE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def retrieve_device_state(self):
        # Retrieve the emergency device from the high shelf
        self.reaching('high shelf')
        self.grasping('emergency device')
        self.lowering('emergency device')
        self.current_state = 'ACTIVATE_DEVICE'

    def activate_device_state(self):
        # Activate the emergency response system
        self.activating('emergency device')
        self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for additional help if needed
        self.calling('emergency services')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and checks
    def is_person_in_distress(self):
        return self.monitoring('elderly person', 'distress')

    def is_emergency_device_needed(self):
        return self.checking('need for emergency device')

    def assisting(self, target):
        self.approaching(target)
        self.asking('about well-being')

    def activating(self, device):
        self.press('activation button', device)

    def calling(self, service):
        self.dialing(service)

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the Butler Robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code:

- Each state represents a phase of the robot's response to the scenario.
- The robot starts by assessing the situation, then provides immediate assistance, retrieves and activates the emergency device, and finally calls for help if necessary.
- Helper methods like `is_person_in_distress` and `is_emergency_device_needed` would contain the logic to evaluate the situation based on sensor data or environmental cues.
- The actions in each state (`assisting`, `activating`, `calling`, etc.) are methods that would encapsulate the robot's physical actions or interactions with the environment or the person in need.
