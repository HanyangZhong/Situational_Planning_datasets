Creating a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described kitchen scene involves defining a sequence of states that the robot transitions through to ensure the child's safety. The FSM will include states that assess the situation, intervene to prevent harm, and ensure ongoing safety. The verbs you've provided will be integrated into the actions of each state.

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'INTERVENE': self.intervene_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_SAFETY': self.monitor_safety_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state of the robot, starting with situation assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if the child is in danger near the stove
        if self.is_child_near_stove():
            self.current_state = 'INTERVENE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SAFETY'

    def intervene_state(self):
        # Intervene to prevent the child from touching the hot stove
        self.removing('pot from stove')
        self.redirecting('child to safe area')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage with the child to maintain their attention away from danger
        self.delivering('safe toys', 'to child')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SAFETY'

    def monitor_safety_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor kitchen safety
        if self.is_child_unattended():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation escalates
        self.calling('for human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods
    def is_child_near_stove(self):
        # Check if child is close to the stove
        return self.monitoring('child', 'stove proximity')

    def is_child_unattended(self):
        # Check if the child is unattended in the kitchen
        return self.monitoring('child', 'unattended')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Instantiate and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code:
- The robot starts in the `INITIAL` state and immediately transitions to `ASSESS_SITUATION`.
- In `ASSESS_SITUATION`, it checks if the child is near the stove.
- If the child is near, it moves to `INTERVENE` to remove the danger and redirect the child.
- `ENGAGE_CHILD` is for keeping the child occupied and away from harm.
- `MONITOR_SAFETY` involves continuous observation to ensure safety.
- If a critical situation arises, it transitions to `CALL_FOR_HELP` to get human assistance.
