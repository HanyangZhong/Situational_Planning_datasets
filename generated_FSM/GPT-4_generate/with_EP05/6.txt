To create a Python code for a Butler Robot's Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) tailored to the laundry room scenario you described, I will follow the guidelines and verbs you provided. Here's how the FSM could be structured:

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the robot
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_CHEMICALS': self.secure_chemicals_state,
            'CLEAN_SPILL': self.clean_spill_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT': self.monitor_environment_state
        }
        # Initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial assessment of the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Check for any immediate dangers or spills
        if self.detects_chemical_spill():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_CHEMICALS'
        elif self.detects_unsecured_chemicals():
            self.current_state = 'CLEAN_SPILL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def secure_chemicals_state(self):
        # Secure all chemicals, ensuring they are out of reach
        self.collecting('chemicals')
        self.placing_down('chemicals', 'safe location')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_SPILL'

    def clean_spill_state(self):
        # Clean any spills safely
        self.gripping('cloth')
        self.wiping('spilled area')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation is beyond the robot's handling capacity
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def monitor_environment_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the environment for any changes or potential hazards
        if self.detects_new_hazard():
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods to simulate robot's perception and actions
    def detects_chemical_spill(self):
        # Implement detection logic here
        return False

    def detects_unsecured_chemicals(self):
        # Implement detection logic here
        return True

    def detects_new_hazard(self):
        # Implement detection logic here
        return False

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Implement calling for help logic here
        pass

    # Main loop to run the FSM
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code implements a finite state machine for a Butler Robot handling a hazardous situation in a laundry room. The robot assesses the situation, secures chemicals, cleans spills, and monitors the environment, calling for help if necessary. Helper methods would need actual implementation depending on the robot's hardware and software capabilities.
