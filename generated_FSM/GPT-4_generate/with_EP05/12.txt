Based on the scenario you've described, where a pregnant woman is navigating a cluttered living room with potential tripping hazards, the butler robot's Finite State Machine (FSM) should prioritize safety and assistance. The robot should identify and mitigate hazards, ensuring a safe environment for the woman. Here's an implementation that reflects this:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_HAZARDS': self.remove_hazards_state,
            'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT': self.monitor_environment_state,
            'ASSIST_WOMAN': self.assist_woman_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state of the Butler Robot
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the environment for potential hazards
        if self.detect_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def remove_hazards_state(self):
        # Remove clutter and hazards from the floor
        self.collecting('items on floor')
        self.placing_down('items in safe area')
        self.straightening('rug edges')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def monitor_environment_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the environment for safety
        if self.detect_new_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'
        elif self.need_to_assist_woman():
            self.current_state = 'ASSIST_WOMAN'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def assist_woman_state(self):
        # Offer assistance to the pregnant woman
        self.reminding('woman', 'to be cautious')
        self.offering('support', 'walking')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance in case of an emergency
        self.calling('emergency services')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods to simulate actions and conditions
    def detect_hazards(self):
        # Detect hazards in the environment
        return True  # Assuming hazards are detected for illustration

    def detect_new_hazards(self):
        # Detect any new hazards that may have arisen
        return False  # Placeholder for actual detection logic

    def need_to_assist_woman(self):
        # Determine if the woman needs assistance
        return False  # Placeholder for actual detection logic

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the Butler Robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code sets up a FSM for a butler robot to ensure the safety and comfort of a pregnant woman in a cluttered living room. Each state in the FSM is designed to address specific aspects of the scenario, from assessing the situation to actively removing hazards and assisting the woman. The `run` method keeps the FSM operational, continuously cycling through the states based on the conditions in the environment and the needs of the woman.
