To create a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described kitchen scene, we need to define the states and transitions that the robot would go through to assist the pregnant woman. The FSM will be designed with the goal of aiding the woman and ensuring her safety.

We'll use Python code to define the FSM, including comments to explain each state and transition. The robot's actions will be chosen from the provided list of verbs. Here's the FSM implementation:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REACH_ALERT_BUTTON': self.reach_alert_button_state,
            'ASSIST_WOMAN': self.assist_woman_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: Robot starts and assesses the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation to decide the next action.
        if self.can_reach_alert_button():
            self.current_state = 'REACH_ALERT_BUTTON'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ASSIST_WOMAN'

    def reach_alert_button_state(self):
        # Reach and press the alert button to call for help.
        self.reaching('alert button')
        self.pressing('alert button')
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_WOMAN'

    def assist_woman_state(self):
        # Assist the woman by providing physical support and comfort.
        self.monitoring('woman')
        self.responding('to woman’s needs')
        if self.needs_additional_help():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for additional help if the situation is beyond the robot's capabilities.
        self.calling_for_help('emergency services')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper functions for actions and conditions
    def can_reach_alert_button(self):
        # Check if the alert button is within reach.
        return self.checking('alert button accessibility')

    def needs_additional_help(self):
        # Assess if additional human assistance is needed.
        return self.monitoring('woman’s condition')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the butler robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM:
- The robot starts in the `INITIAL` state, then assesses the situation.
- Depending on whether the alert button is reachable, it either reaches for the button (`REACH_ALERT_BUTTON`) or directly assists the woman (`ASSIST_WOMAN`).
- After performing the immediate action, it re-assesses the woman's condition. If she needs more help than the robot can provide, it transitions to the `CALL_FOR_HELP` state.
- The helper functions (`can_reach_alert_button`, `needs_additional_help`) represent the robot's internal logic to make decisions based on the situation. These functions would include the actual implementation of the robot's sensors and decision-making algorithms.

This code provides a basic structure for the FSM and can be expanded with more detailed logic and sensor integration for a real-world application.
