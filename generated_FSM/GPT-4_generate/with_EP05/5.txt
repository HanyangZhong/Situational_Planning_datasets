To design a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot that handles the described bathroom scene, we need to structure the states and transitions to address the issues of unsecured medications and maintain safety. The states should reflect the steps the robot takes to secure the medications and ensure the bathroom is safe, especially from children who might mistake the pills for candy. Here is an example of how this FSM could be implemented in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_MEDICATION': self.secure_medication_state,
            'CLEAN_SPILL': self.clean_spill_state,
            'FINAL_CHECK': self.final_check_state,
            'COMPLETE': self.complete_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: Start by assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation to determine the next action.
        if self.is_medication_unsecured():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_MEDICATION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CLEAN_SPILL'

    def secure_medication_state(self):
        # Secure any open medication containers.
        self.closing('medication bottles')
        self.placing_down('bottles', 'proper shelf')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_SPILL'

    def clean_spill_state(self):
        # Clean up any spilled pills.
        self.collecting('spilled pills')
        self.placing_down('pills', 'in bottle')
        self.current_state = 'FINAL_CHECK'

    def final_check_state(self):
        # Final check for safety and order.
        if self.is_area_safe_and_clean():
            self.current_state = 'COMPLETE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def complete_state(self):
        # Task is completed. The robot can move on to other tasks.
        pass

    # Helper methods to simulate actions and checks
    def is_medication_unsecured(self):
        # Check if any medication is unsecured
        return True  # Placeholder for actual checking logic

    def is_area_safe_and_clean(self):
        # Check if the area is now safe and clean
        return True  # Placeholder for actual checking logic

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while self.current_state != 'COMPLETE':
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this example, the FSM starts by assessing the situation, then moves through states to secure medication, clean any spill, and perform a final check to ensure safety. Each state performs actions relevant to the situation, using verbs from the provided list. The FSM continues to run until the 'COMPLETE' state is reached, indicating that the task is finished. The helper methods `is_medication_unsecured` and `is_area_safe_and_clean` are placeholders for actual logic that the robot would use to make these determinations.
