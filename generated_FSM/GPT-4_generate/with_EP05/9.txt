To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described scenario, we will define states and transitions that best suit the task of managing medication and tidying up the living area. Each state will correspond to an action or a check the robot needs to perform, utilizing the verbs provided.

Here's the Python code for the FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define states in the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'CHECK_MEDICATION': self.check_medication_state,
            'ORGANIZE_MEDICATION': self.organize_medication_state,
            'CLEAN_UP_MESS': self.clean_up_mess_state,
            'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT': self.monitor_environment_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: Decide the next action
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_MEDICATION'

    def check_medication_state(self):
        # Check the medication organization
        if self.is_medication_disorganized():
            self.current_state = 'ORGANIZE_MEDICATION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CLEAN_UP_MESS'

    def organize_medication_state(self):
        # Organize the medications properly
        self.collecting('medications')
        self.arranging('medications', 'organizer')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_UP_MESS'

    def clean_up_mess_state(self):
        # Clean up the spilled water and tidy the area
        self.wiping('spilled water')
        self.folding('disheveled newspaper')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def monitor_environment_state(self):
        # Monitor the environment for any further disarray or needs
        if self.needs_assistance():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if needed
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and checks
    def is_medication_disorganized(self):
        # Implement logic to check medication organization
        return True  # Placeholder

    def needs_assistance(self):
        # Implement logic to determine if human assistance is needed
        return False  # Placeholder

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Implement logic for calling for help
        pass  # Placeholder

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the Butler Robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code:
- The `ButlerRobotFSM` class defines the states and their corresponding methods.
- Each state method contains logic to perform specific actions and determine the next state.
- Helper methods (placeholders) are included for actions like checking medication organization and calling for help.
- The `run` method continuously executes the FSM loop, allowing the robot to transition between states based on the current situation.
