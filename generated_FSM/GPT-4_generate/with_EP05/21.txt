To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot responding to the described scene, we need to define states and transitions that reflect the actions required in this specific scenario. Here's how the FSM could be structured:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REACH_BUTTON': self.reach_button_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'ASSIST_PERSON': self.assist_person_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state of the Butler Robot. Start with assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation in the room, identify the person on the floor and the unreachable button
        if self.is_person_on_floor() and self.is_button_unreachable():
            self.current_state = 'REACH_BUTTON'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def reach_button_state(self):
        # Reach the emergency alert button to call for help
        self.reaching('emergency alert button')
        self.pressing('emergency alert button')
        self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for additional help if necessary
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_PERSON'

    def assist_person_state(self):
        # Assist the person on the floor
        self.checking('person\'s condition')
        self.grasping('person')
        self.lifting('person')
        self.placing_down('person', 'safe position')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation and provide assistance as needed
        if self.is_person_stable():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ASSIST_PERSON'

    # Helper methods for actions and checks
    def is_person_on_floor(self):
        # Method to check if the person is on the floor
        return True  # Placeholder

    def is_button_unreachable(self):
        # Method to check if the button is unreachable
        return True  # Placeholder

    def is_person_stable(self):
        # Method to check if the person is in a stable condition
        return True  # Placeholder

    def reaching(self, target):
        # Action of reaching for an object
        pass  # Placeholder

    def pressing(self, button):
        # Action of pressing a button
        pass  # Placeholder

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Action of calling for help
        pass  # Placeholder

    def checking(self, target):
        # Action of checking a person's condition
        pass  # Placeholder

    def grasping(self, target):
        # Action of grasping
        pass  # Placeholder

    def lifting(self, target):
        # Action of lifting
        pass  # Placeholder

    def placing_down(self, target, location):
        # Action of placing down
        pass  # Placeholder

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the ButlerRobotFSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, each state corresponds to a particular action or assessment needed in the situation. The transitions between states are determined by the conditions in each state's method. The actions such as `reaching`, `pressing`, and `calling_for_help` are placeholders and would need to be implemented based on the robot's capabilities.
