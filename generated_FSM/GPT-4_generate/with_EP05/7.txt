To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot tasked with handling the cluttered hallway scene you described, we'll follow these steps:

1. Define the states: Each state represents a particular phase in dealing with the cluttered hallway.
2. Define the transitions: These are the conditions that trigger the robot to move from one state to another.
3. Implement the actions: These are the specific tasks the robot will perform in each state, using the verbs you provided.

Here's an example FSM implemented in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CLEAN_HALLWAY': self.clean_hallway_state,
            'REARRANGE_SHOES': self.rearrange_shoes_state,
            'STRAIGHTEN_RUG': self.straighten_rug_state,
            'FINAL_CHECK': self.final_check_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial assessment of the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Check the hallway for obstacles and hazards
        if self.is_hallway_cluttered():
            self.current_state = 'CLEAN_HALLWAY'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'FINAL_CHECK'

    def clean_hallway_state(self):
        # Clean up items from the floor
        self.collecting('items', 'hallway')
        self.placing_down('items', 'appropriate places')
        # Check if shoes are disarranged
        if self.are_shoes_disarranged():
            self.current_state = 'REARRANGE_SHOES'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'STRAIGHTEN_RUG'

    def rearrange_shoes_state(self):
        # Rearrange shoes on the rack
        self.arranging('shoes', 'shoe rack')
        self.current_state = 'STRAIGHTEN_RUG'

    def straighten_rug_state(self):
        # Straighten the hallway rug
        self.flattening('hallway rug')
        self.current_state = 'FINAL_CHECK'

    def final_check_state(self):
        # Final assessment of the hallway
        if self.is_hallway_safe():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if needed
        self.calling_for_help('hallway safety')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and conditions
    def is_hallway_cluttered(self):
        # Check if the hallway is cluttered
        return True  # Placeholder for actual sensing logic

    def are_shoes_disarranged(self):
        # Check if shoes are disarranged
        return True  # Placeholder for actual sensing logic

    def is_hallway_safe(self):
        # Check if the hallway is now safe
        return True  # Placeholder for actual sensing logic

    def calling_for_help(self, reason):
        # Action to call for help
        pass  # Placeholder for actual communication logic

    # Main loop to run the FSM
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Instantiate and run the FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code:
- We define various states (`INITIAL`, `ASSESS_SITUATION`, etc.) and transitions between them based on the situation in the hallway.
- Each state has associated actions (e.g., `collecting`, `placing down`, `arranging`) which the robot performs.
- Helper methods (`is_hallway_cluttered`, `are_shoes_disarranged`, `is_hallway_safe`) represent the robot's sensory checks.
- `calling_for_help` is an action for situations where human intervention is needed.
- The `run` method keeps the FSM running, transitioning between states as conditions change.
