To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in a scenario where a child is reaching for sharp objects in a kitchen, I'll define states and transitions based on the situation and the verbs you provided. The FSM will include states like assessing the situation, engaging with the child, removing dangerous items, and monitoring the environment. I'll use the verbs you've listed for actions within each state.

Here's a Python implementation of such an FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'REMOVE_DANGER': self.remove_danger_state,
            'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT': self.monitor_environment_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state, start by assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if the child is reaching for dangerous items
        if self.is_child_reaching_danger():
            self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage with the child to distract them from danger
        self.engaging_child()
        self.current_state = 'REMOVE_DANGER'

    def remove_danger_state(self):
        # Remove the dangerous items from reach
        self.removing('sharp objects')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def monitor_environment_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child and environment
        if self.is_child_safe():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation escalates
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and conditions
    def is_child_reaching_danger(self):
        # Check if the child is reaching for dangerous items
        return self.monitoring('child', 'danger')

    def engaging_child(self):
        # Engage with the child to divert their attention
        self.reminding('child', 'safety')

    def removing(self, item):
        # Remove the dangerous item
        self.grasping(item)
        self.placing_down(item, 'safe place')

    def is_child_safe(self):
        # Check if the child is in a safe environment
        return self.monitoring('child', 'safety')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.calling('human assistance')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM:
- The robot starts in the `INITIAL` state and then assesses the situation.
- If the child is reaching for dangerous items, the robot engages with the child (`ENGAGE_CHILD`), then removes the danger (`REMOVE_DANGER`), and finally monitors the environment (`MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT`).
- If at any point the child's safety is at risk, the robot will call for human assistance (`CALL_FOR_HELP`).

This implementation uses the verbs you provided and follows proper Python syntax with comments explaining each state. The FSM continuously cycles through these states, assessing and reacting to the situation as needed.
