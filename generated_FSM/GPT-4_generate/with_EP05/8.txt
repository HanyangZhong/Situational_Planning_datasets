To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot dealing with the described kitchen scenario, we'll define states and actions that align with the tasks at hand. The robot's primary objective is to ensure safety by properly arranging the knives in the drawer.

We will use the verbs provided to define the actions in each state. Here's how the FSM could be structured:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'OPEN_DRAWER': self.open_drawer_state,
            'REARRANGE_KNIVES': self.rearrange_knives_state,
            'CLOSE_DRAWER': self.close_drawer_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'FINISHED': self.finished_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: start by assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation in the kitchen
        if self.is_drawer_open():
            self.current_state = 'OPEN_DRAWER'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'FINISHED'

    def open_drawer_state(self):
        # Safely open the drawer if it's not fully open.
        self.opening('drawer')
        self.current_state = 'REARRANGE_KNIVES'

    def rearrange_knives_state(self):
        # Carefully rearrange the knives in the drawer
        self.rearranging('knives', 'safe orientation')
        self.current_state = 'CLOSE_DRAWER'

    def close_drawer_state(self):
        # Close the drawer after rearranging the knives
        self.closing('drawer')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Monitor the situation to ensure safety
        self.monitoring('kitchen safety')
        self.current_state = 'FINISHED'

    def finished_state(self):
        # End state: the task is completed
        pass

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_drawer_open(self):
        # Check if the drawer is open
        return True  # Assume the drawer is open for this example

    def opening(self, item):
        print(f"Opening {item}.")

    def rearranging(self, item, orientation):
        print(f"Rearranging {item} in {orientation}.")

    def closing(self, item):
        print(f"Closing {item}.")

    def monitoring(self, task):
        print(f"Monitoring {task}.")

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while self.current_state != 'FINISHED':
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, the butler robot first assesses the situation, opens the drawer if necessary, rearranges the knives safely, closes the drawer, and then monitors the situation to ensure ongoing safety. The actions are hypothetical, assuming the robot has capabilities to perform these tasks.
