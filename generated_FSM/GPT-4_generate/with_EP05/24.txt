To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described playroom scene, we'll define different states that the robot can be in, and specify transitions between these states based on the situation. Here, our primary concern is the child's safety, particularly regarding the small toys that pose a choking hazard.

Here's a Python FSM implementation for this scenario:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_HAZARDS': self.remove_hazards_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state, starts with assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if there are choking hazards near the child
        if self.detect_choking_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def remove_hazards_state(self):
        # Remove small toys that are choking hazards
        self.collecting('small toys')
        self.placing_down('small toys', 'safe area')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage the child with safe play activities
        self.delivering('safe toys', 'to child')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child's play
        if self.detect_new_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'
        elif self.is_child_unsafe():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance in case of an emergency
        self.calling_for_help('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for various actions and checks
    def detect_choking_hazards(self):
        # Check for small toys near the child
        return self.checking('small toys', 'near child')

    def detect_new_hazards(self):
        # Detect new hazards during play
        return self.monitoring('new toys', 'near child')

    def is_child_unsafe(self):
        # Check if the child is in any immediate danger
        return self.monitoring('child', 'safety')

    def calling_for_help(self, entity):
        # Call for help
        self.calling(entity)

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This FSM uses a loop to continuously run through the states based on the current situation in the playroom. The robot starts by assessing the situation, identifying and removing choking hazards, engaging the child with safe activities, and monitoring the play. If a dangerous situation arises, it can call for human assistance. The helper methods (`detect_choking_hazards`, `detect_new_hazards`, `is_child_unsafe`, `calling_for_help`) are placeholders for the actual implementations of these checks and actions.
