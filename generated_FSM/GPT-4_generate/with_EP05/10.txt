To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described scenario, we will define states and transitions relevant to the situation. The robot's main goal is to assist the wheelchair user by clearing the path to the desk. Here's how the FSM can be structured:

1. **Initial State**: The robot starts in this state.
2. **Assess Situation**: The robot assesses the situation in the study room.
3. **Clear Path**: If the path is blocked, the robot clears it.
4. **Assist User**: If the user needs assistance reaching the desk or using the computer.
5. **Monitor Room**: After clearing the path or assisting, the robot monitors the room for further assistance.
6. **Call for Help**: If the robot encounters a situation it cannot handle, it calls for human assistance.

Each state will involve actions from the provided list. Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CLEAR_PATH': self.clear_path_state,
            'ASSIST_USER': self.assist_user_state,
            'MONITOR_ROOM': self.monitor_room_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Robot's initial state, starts with assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation in the study room.
        if self.is_path_blocked():
            self.current_state = 'CLEAR_PATH'
        elif self.does_user_need_assistance():
            self.current_state = 'ASSIST_USER'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ROOM'

    def clear_path_state(self):
        # Clear the path to the desk.
        self.grasping('office chair')
        self.transporting('office chair', 'to a suitable location')
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_USER'

    def assist_user_state(self):
        # Assist the user in reaching or using the desk.
        self.assisting_user()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ROOM'

    def monitor_room_state(self):
        # Monitor the room for any further assistance.
        if self.is_user_assistance_required_again():
            self.current_state = 'ASSIST_USER'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if needed.
        self.calling('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods and condition checks
    def is_path_blocked(self):
        # Check if the path to the desk is blocked.
        return self.checking('path obstruction')

    def does_user_need_assistance(self):
        # Check if the user needs assistance.
        return self.monitoring('user', 'assistance need')

    def assisting_user(self):
        # Assist the user as needed.
        self.responding('user assistance request')

    def is_user_assistance_required_again(self):
        # Check if the user needs assistance again.
        return self.monitoring('user', 'repeated assistance need')

    def calling(self, assistance_type):
        # Call for specified type of assistance.
        print(f"Calling for {assistance_type}")

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the butler robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, the robot transitions between states based on the assessment of the situation and the needs of the user. Each state involves specific actions, and the robot can call for human help if it encounters a situation beyond its capabilities. The `checking`, `monitoring`, `responding`, and `calling` methods are placeholders for actual implementation of these actions.
