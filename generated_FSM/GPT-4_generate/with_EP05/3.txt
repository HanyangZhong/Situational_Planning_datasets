To create a finite state machine (FSM) in Python for a butler robot in the scenario described, we need to tailor the states and actions to the specific situation: a lit candle on a bookshelf posing a fire hazard. Let's break down the tasks that the robot should perform:

1. **Assess the Situation:** Check the proximity of the candle to flammable items.
2. **Extinguish Candle:** Safely extinguish the candle flame.
3. **Remove Candle:** Carefully remove the candle from the bookshelf.
4. **Monitor for Safety:** Keep monitoring the area to ensure safety.

Here's how you could implement this in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define states
        self.states = {
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'EXTINGUISH_CANDLE': self.extinguish_candle_state,
            'REMOVE_CANDLE': self.remove_candle_state,
            'MONITOR_SAFETY': self.monitor_safety_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Check the proximity of the candle to flammable items
        if self.is_candle_too_close_to_books():
            self.current_state = 'EXTINGUISH_CANDLE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SAFETY'

    def extinguish_candle_state(self):
        # Extinguish the candle flame
        self.lowering('flame extinguisher')
        self.current_state = 'REMOVE_CANDLE'

    def remove_candle_state(self):
        # Remove the candle from the bookshelf
        self.gripping('candle holder')
        self.transporting('candle', 'safe location')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SAFETY'

    def monitor_safety_state(self):
        # Keep monitoring the area to ensure safety
        if self.is_any_new_hazard():
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation is beyond the robot's capability
        self.calling_for_help()

    # Helper methods for various actions
    def is_candle_too_close_to_books(self):
        # Check proximity of candle to books
        return True  # Placeholder for actual sensing logic

    def is_any_new_hazard(self):
        # Check for any new hazards
        return False  # Placeholder for actual sensing logic

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Implement logic to call for help
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the butler robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, each state corresponds to a specific action or set of actions that the robot should perform. The `run` method continuously loops through the current state, executing its corresponding function. The helper methods like `is_candle_too_close_to_books` would contain the actual sensing and decision-making logic, which is simplified here for illustration.
