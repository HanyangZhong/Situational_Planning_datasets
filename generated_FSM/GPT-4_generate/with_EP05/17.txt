To create a finite state machine (FSM) in Python for a butler robot in the described scenario, we need to define the states and transitions specific to the situation. The robot's primary goal is to ensure the safety of the child near the staircase. We'll use the verbs provided to define the actions in each state. Here's an example implementation:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define states
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'RELOCATE_CHILD': self.relocate_child_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: start with assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation to determine the next step
        if self.is_child_near_stairs():
            self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage with the child to grab their attention
        self.grasping('toy')
        self.delivering('toy', 'child')
        self.current_state = 'RELOCATE_CHILD'

    def relocate_child_state(self):
        # Safely relocate the child away from the stairs
        self.grasping('child gently')
        self.transporting('child', 'safe area')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child's safety
        if self.is_child_in_danger():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance in case of an emergency
        self.calling('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions / conditions
    def is_child_near_stairs(self):
        # Logic to determine if the child is near the stairs
        return True  # Simplified for example

    def is_child_in_danger(self):
        # Logic to determine if the child is in danger
        return False  # Simplified for example

    def run(self):
        # Run the FSM loop
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code:
- Each state represents a different phase of the robot's operation.
- Actions such as `grasping`, `transporting`, `delivering`, and `calling` are used as per your verb list.
- Helper methods like `is_child_near_stairs` and `is_child_in_danger` would contain the logic to assess the situation based on the robot's sensors or programmed criteria.
- The `run` method continuously cycles through the FSM, executing the appropriate state's action.
