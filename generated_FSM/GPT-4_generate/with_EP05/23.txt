Based on your description of the living room scene and the requirements for a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot, here's an example of Python code that implements the FSM logic for the given scenario. This code follows the structure you provided, adapting it to the specific context of a child playing roughly with a large dog.

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CALM_DOG': self.calm_dog_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: start with situation assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the interaction between the child and the dog
        if self.is_play_too_rough():
            self.current_state = 'CALM_DOG'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def calm_dog_state(self):
        # Calm the dog to ensure the child's safety
        self.responding('to the dog')
        self.reminding('the dog', 'calm behavior')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage with the child to distract from rough play
        self.collecting('safe toys')
        self.delivering('safe toys', 'to the child')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child and dog's interaction
        if self.is_play_too_rough():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance in case of an unmanageable situation
        self.calling('for human help')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods
    def is_play_too_rough(self):
        # Check if the play between the child and dog is too rough
        play_too_rough = self.monitoring('child and dog interaction')
        return play_too_rough

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, the robot assesses the situation, responds to the dog, engages with the child with safe toys, and continuously monitors the play. If necessary, it calls for human assistance. The verbs from your list are used in the action methods to describe the robot's tasks.
