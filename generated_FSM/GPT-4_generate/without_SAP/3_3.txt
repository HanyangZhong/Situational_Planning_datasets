Sure, I will rewrite the ButlerRobotHFSM for this situation which involves the risk of fire from a candle near a pile of books. I will utilize the verbs you provided within the code.

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'CHECK_SITUATION': self.check_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_CANDLE': self.remove_candle_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Butler Robot initial state. Start with a check.
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_SITUATION'

    def check_situation_state(self):
        # Check if the candle is too close to the books.
        if self.is_candle_dangerous():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_CANDLE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def remove_candle_state(self):
        # If the candle is too close to the books, remove it safely.
        self.extinguish_and_remove_candle()
        self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the candle still poses a threat.
        if self.is_candle_dangerous():
            self.call_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_candle_dangerous(self):
        # Simulated method to check if the candle is dangerously close to the books.
        candle_dangerous = self.checking('candle proximity')
        return candle_dangerous

    def extinguish_and_remove_candle(self):
        # Simulated methods to carefully remove the candle.
        self.gripping('candle')
        self.lifting('candle')
        self.transporting('candle', 'safer location')
        self.releasing('candle')

    def call_for_help(self):
        # Simulated method to call for human help.
        self.calling_for_help('fire risk')

    # Run the HFSM loop 
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()
            

# Create an instance of the HFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```
The methods checking, gripping, lifting, etc. are not implemented in this skeleton code, and are commented as being 'simulated'. They would need to be implemented according to the actual mechanisms of the robot. The verbs used in these methods represent the FSM actions list provided.
