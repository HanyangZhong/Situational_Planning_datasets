Below is the code that models the situation described in Python using a Hierarchical Finite State Machine. 

The Butler Robot has to fulfill a dual role in this scenario - to help the pregnant woman by removing potential tripping hazards and to keep the living room orderly and neat by managing clutter and adjusting furniture to widen the walking space.

Note: The robot is expected to not interact directly with the woman, since that could cause discomfort or unexpected incidents.

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states and finite state machine's main states and functions 
        self.states = {

            'MONITOR_SPACE': self.monitor_space_state
        }

        # Define the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):

            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SPACE'

    # Actions / Annotation methods

        floor_cluttered = self.checking('floor')

        furniture_tightly_spaced = self.checking('furniture')
        return furniture_tightly_spaced

    def is_rug_curled(self):
        rug_curled = self.checking('rug')
        return rug_curled

    def straightening(self, item):
        self.reaching(item)
        self.flipping(item)

    def is_furniture_moved(self):
        furniture_moved = self.checking('furniture position')
        return furniture_moved

    # Run the HFSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the Robotic Butler and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```
Please note that the physical actions in the status functions are conceptual. In real world, specifics of how the robot takes actions, such as grasping, lifting, or sliding items, would depend on the robot's hardware / abilities. Also, "monitor_space_state" should have a delay or wait period to it doesn't hog valuable CPU cycles.
