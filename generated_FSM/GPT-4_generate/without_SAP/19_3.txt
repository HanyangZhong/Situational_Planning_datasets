Here is a Python Finite State Machine code based on your described scene:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'GRAB_CHILD': self.grab_child_state,
            'MOVE_CHILD': self.move_child_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Butler Robot initial state. Start with an assessment.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if the child is close to the stove and reaching for the pot
        if self.is_child_close_to_stove() and self.is_child_reaching_for_pot():
            self.current_state = 'GRAB_CHILD'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def grab_child_state(self):
        # If the child is close to the stove and reaching for the pot, grab the child.
        self.gripping('child')
        self.current_state = 'MOVE_CHILD'

    def move_child_state(self):
        # Move the child to a safe location away from the stove.
        self.transporting('child', 'safe location')
        self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance.
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_child_close_to_stove(self):
        child_close = self.checking('child', 'stove')
        return child_close

    def is_child_reaching_for_pot(self):
        child_reaching = self.monitoring('child', 'pot')
        return child_reaching

    def gripping(self, item):
        print(f"Gripping {item}")

    def transporting(self, item, location):
        print(f"Transporting {item} to {location}")

    def calling_for_help(self):
        print("Calling for help")

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()


# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```
Please note your methods `checking` and `monitoring` were not defined in your FSM class, so you might want to add these implementations based on your setup. Be aware that this is a rather simplistic FSM and in a real-world scenario, a more comprehensive understanding and implementation of child safety, as well as handling the various stages in the FSM, would be required.
