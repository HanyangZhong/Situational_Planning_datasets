Here's a finite state machine in python for the described scenario:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REACH_MEDICINE': self.reach_medicine_state,
            'DELIVER_MEDICINE': self.deliver_medicine_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Butler Robot initial state. Start with an assessment.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the person's condition and the medicine's location
        if self.is_person_unable() and self.is_medicine_out_of_reach():
            self.current_state = 'REACH_MEDICINE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def reach_medicine_state(self):
        # If the medicine is out of reach, grab it.
        self.reaching('medicine')
        self.grasping('medicine')
        self.current_state = 'DELIVER_MEDICINE'

    def deliver_medicine_state(self):
        # Deliver the medicine to the person
        self.delivering('medicine', 'person')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the person's condition is critical
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_person_unable(self):
        person_unable = self.monitoring('person')
        return person_unable

    def is_medicine_out_of_reach(self):
        medicine_out_of_reach = self.checking('medicine', 'location')
        return medicine_out_of_reach

    def reaching(self, object):
        # Simulated action of reaching for the medicine
        pass

    def grasping(self, object):
        # Simulated action of grasping the medicine
        pass

    def delivering(self, object, recipient):
        # Simulated action of delivering the medicine to the person
        pass

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Simulated action of calling for human assistance
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()


# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, the robot first assesses the situation. If the person is unable to reach the medicine and the medicine is out of reach, the robot reaches for the medicine and delivers it to the person. If the person's condition is critical, the robot calls for assistance. The robot continuously loops over these steps.
