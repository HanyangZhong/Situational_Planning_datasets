Here is a Python code for the application you explained. The situation we are addressing is in the playroom where a child poses a potential choking risk to himself by playing with small toys:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'MONITOR_CHILD': self.monitor_child_state,
            'REMOVE_TOY': self.remove_toy_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'CREATE_SAFER_ENVIRONMENT': self.create_safer_environment_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Butler Robot initial state. Start by monitoring the child.
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_CHILD'

    def monitor_child_state(self):
        # Monitor the child
        if self.is_toy_near_mouth():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_TOY'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CREATE_SAFER_ENVIRONMENT'
        
    def remove_toy_state(self):
        # if the toy is near mouth, quickly remove it to prevent a choking hazard
        self.gripping('small toy')
        self.removing('small toy', 'from child')
        self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the child is at risk
        self.calling('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
    
    def create_safer_environment_state(self):
        # When child is safe, the robot can arrange toys in a safer manner
        self.collecting('small toys')
        self.placing_down('small toys', 'out of reach')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_toy_near_mouth(self):
        toy_near_mouth = self.checking('toy', 'child mouth')
        return toy_near_mouth

    def gripping(self, item):
        # Action for robot to grip an item
        pass

    def removing(self, item, location):
        # Action for robot to remove an item from a particular location
        pass

    def calling(self, entity):
        # Action for robot to call for help
        pass
    
    def collecting(self, items):
        # Action for robot to collect small toys
        pass
    
    def placing_down(self, items, location):
        # Action for robot to place items down at a particular location
        pass

    def checking(self, item, location):
        # Check if an item is found at a particular location
        return False

    def run(self):
        # Run the FSM loop
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```
In this code, we have set up a finite state machine (FSM) for the robot to interact with the children and respond to potential dangerous situations. The robot is able to grip and remove dangerous toys, call for human assistance and even arrange toys in a safer manner. Note that calling for help maybe done in different ways, including messaging a human monitor, sounding an alarm, etc.
