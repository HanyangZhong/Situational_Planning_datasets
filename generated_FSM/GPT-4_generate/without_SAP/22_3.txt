The Python program you've requested, implementing a Finite State Machine (FSM) using your provided scenario and action list would look like this:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initialState,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assessSituationState,
            'REACH_BUTTON': self.reachButtonState,
            'PRESS_BUTTON': self.pressButtonState,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.callForHelpState,
        }
        # Initial state
        self.currentState = 'INITIAL'

    def initialState(self):
        # Initial state just transfers to the assessment state
        self.currentState = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assessSituationState(self):
        # Assess the situation, if the woman is on the floor and unable to reach the button
        # then go to the 'REACH_BUTTON' state, otherwise 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        if self.womanOnFloor() and self.buttonNotReached():
            self.currentState = 'REACH_BUTTON'
        else:
            self.currentState = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def reachButtonState(self):
        # Reach to the button, if successful, then press it. 
        # If not successful, then change to 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        if self.reachForButton():
            self.currentState = 'PRESS_BUTTON'
        else:
            self.currentState = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def pressButtonState(self):
        # Press the button. If successful, then remain in this state,
        # If not successful, then change to 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        if not self.pressButton():
            self.currentState = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def callForHelpState(self):
        # Call for help and go back to initial state 
        self.callForHelp()
        self.currentState = 'INITIAL'

    # Following are the function definitions for the actions mentioned in each state

    def womanOnFloor(self):
        # Here should be the implementation of checking if woman is on the floor
        pass

    def buttonNotReached(self):
        # Here should be the implementation of checking if woman can't reach the button
        pass

    def reachForButton(self):
        # Here should be the logic for reaching the button
        pass

    def pressButton(self):
        # Here should be the logic for pressing the button
        pass

    def callForHelp(self):
        # Here should be the logic for calling for help
        pass

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.currentState]()


# Create an instance
butlerRobot = ButlerRobotFSM()
# Start the finite state machine
butlerRobot.run()
```

The program begins with creating an instance for the robot butler finite state machine class and then initiating the state machine. The state machine then continuously runs, looping through the different states based on the conditions set in each state until it reaches the 'CALL_FOR_HELP' state where in assistance for help is made.
