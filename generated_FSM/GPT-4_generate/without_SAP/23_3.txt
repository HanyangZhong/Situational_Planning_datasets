Here's how I would interpret your scene into a Hierarchical Finite State Machine for the butler robot:

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Butler Robot initial state. Start with an assessment.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation and check if it's becoming too rough
        if self.is_play_getting_rough() and self.are_child_and_dog_playing():
            self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # If the play is getting too rough, engage the child by creating a distraction.
        self.create_distraction()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child's play. If it becomes rough, engage the child.
        if self.is_play_getting_rough():
            self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'
        elif self.is_safety_on_risk():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the play is out of control or if the child is in danger.
        self.call_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def is_play_getting_rough(self):
        play_getting_rough = self.monitoring('play')
        return play_getting_rough

    def are_child_and_dog_playing(self):
        child_and_dog_playing = self.monitoring('child and dog')
        return child_and_dog_playing

    def create_distraction(self):
        self.collecting('toy')
        self.delivering('toy', 'child')

    def is_safety_on_risk(self):
        safety_risk = self.assessing('safety risk')
        return safety_risk

    def call_for_help(self):
        self.calling('higher authority')

    # Run the HFSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the HFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In the above script, as a butler robot, I am first assessing the situation. If the situation is getting rough, I will engage the child by creating a distraction and monitoring the play. If the situation is still out of control, I'm calling for help.
