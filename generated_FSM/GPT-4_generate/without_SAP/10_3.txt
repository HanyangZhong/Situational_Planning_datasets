Here is an example of how your description can be interpreted in a Finite State Machine implemented in Python:

```python
class OfficeButlerFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Setup the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'CHECK_PATH': self.check_path_state,
            'MOVE_CHAIR': self.move_chair_state,
            'CHECK_CHAIR_POSITION': self.check_chair_position_state,
            'RETURN_TO_USER': self.return_to_user_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state.
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_PATH'

    def check_path_state(self):
        # Check if the path is blocked by a chair.
        if self.is_path_blocked():
            self.current_state = 'MOVE_CHAIR'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'RETURN_TO_USER'

    def move_chair_state(self):
        # The path is blocked, move the chair.
        self.reaching('office chair')
        self.gripping('office chair')
        self.lifting('office chair')
        self.transporting('office chair')
        self.lowering('office chair')
        self.releasing('office chair')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_CHAIR_POSITION'

    def check_chair_position_state(self):
        # Check the chair's new position.
        if self.is_chair_correctly_positioned():
            self.current_state = 'RETURN_TO_USER'
        else: 
            self.current_state = 'MOVE_CHAIR'

    def return_to_user_state(self):
        # Return to the user after clearing the path.
        self.monitoring('wheelchair user')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions
    def is_path_blocked(self):
        path_blocked = self.checking('path to desk')
        return path_blocked

    def is_chair_correctly_positioned(self):
        chair_correctly_positioned = self.checking('chair position')
        return chair_correctly_positioned

    def checking(self, item):
        # return the status of the item, in a real world scenario this should access sensors and return real data
        pass

    def reaching(self, item):
        # perform action associated with reaching out to the item
        pass

    def gripping(self, item):
        # perform action associated with gripping the item
        pass

    def lifting(self, item):
        # perform action associated with lifting the item
        pass

    def transporting(self, item):
        # perform action associated with transporting the item
        pass

    def lowering(self, item):
        # perform action associated with lowering the item
        pass

    def releasing(self, item):
        # perform action associated with releasing the item
        pass

    def monitoring(self, item):
        # perform action associated with monitoring the item
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the HFSM and run it
office_butler = OfficeButlerFSM()
office_butler.run()
```
In this FSM, the robot checks the path to the desk first. If it is clear, it returns to its user. If a blocking chair is detected, it proceeds to move the chair out of the way. After moving the chair, the robot checks to ensure it is properly repositioned and no longer blocking the path. The robot repeats this process until the path is clear, then returns to the user. During each action, the robot checks and reacts appropriately to maintain a clear path for the user.
It is worth mentioning that I left the function bodies of the action methods empty for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, the function bodies would contain code to interact with the robot's hardware and sensors.
