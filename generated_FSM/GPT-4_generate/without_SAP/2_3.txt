Here is a Python implementation of a Finite State Machine for a butler robot:

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Set up the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'HANDLE_SPILL': self.handle_spill_state,
            'CLEAN_SPILL': self.clean_spill_state,
            'FINISHING': self.finishing_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # The Butler Robot's initial state. Start with assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Check if there's a spill, if so change the state to HANDLE_SPILL.
        if self.detect_spill():
            self.current_state = 'HANDLE_SPILL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'FINISHING'

    def handle_spill_state(self):
        # Pick up the bottle and pot, then change the state to CLEAN_SPILL.
        self.gripping('olive oil bottle')
        self.lifting('olive oil bottle')
        self.reaching('kitchen counter')
        self.placing_down('olive oil bottle')

        self.gripping('pot handle')
        self.lifting('pot handle')
        self.reaching('stove')
        self.placing_down('pot handle')

        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_SPILL'

    def clean_spill_state(self):
        # Mop the floor and after cleaning, change the state to FINISHING.
        self.reaching('mop')
        self.gripping('mop handle')
        self.mopping('kitchen floor')
        self.releasing('mop handle')

        self.current_state = 'FINISHING'

    def finishing_state(self):
        # In the finishing stage after all tasks are complete.
        print('All tasks are complete.')

    # Actions 
    def detect_spill(self):
        print('Detecting spill...')
        # Detect spill logically, return True for now
        return True

    def gripping(self, item_name):
        print(f"Gripping {item_name}...")

    def lifting(self, item_name):
        print(f"Lifting {item_name}...")

    def reaching(self, place_name):
        print(f"Reaching {place_name}...")

    def placing_down(self, item_name):
        print(f"Placing down {item_name}...")

    def mopping(self, place_name):
        print(f"Mopping {place_name}...")

    def releasing(self, item_name):
        print(f"Releasing {item_name}...")

    # Run the HFSM loop
    def run(self):
        while self.current_state != 'FINISHING':
            self.states[self.current_state]()
            

# Create an instance of the HFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This is a simplified version, but it should give a good starting point. The verbs from the list were chosen to describe what tasks the Butler Robot must perform in order to address the spill. The comments in the coding explain each step and state in the FSM and their purpose.
