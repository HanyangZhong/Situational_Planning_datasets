In response to your request, here's an example of how you could structure the state machine in python code:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # State lookup dictionary
        self.state_functions = {
            'scanning': self.scanning,
            'collecting': self.collecting,
            'arranging': self.arranging,
            'closing': self.closing,
            'checking': self.checking,
        }

        self.current_state = 'scanning' # The robot begins by scanning the room

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Execute the function associated with the current state
            self.current_state = self.state_functions[self.current_state]()

    def scanning(self):
        if self.detect_hazards(): # If hazards are detected, the robot begins to collect them
            return 'collecting'
        else:
            return 'scanning' # If no hazards are detected, continue scanning
    
    def collecting(self):
        self.collect_hazards()
        # After collecting hazards, start arranging them safely
        return 'arranging'
    
    def arranging(self):
        self.arrange_hazards_safely()
        # Next step, try to close containers if they are open
        return 'closing'
    
    def closing(self):
        self.close_containers()
        # After closing containers, check if any remained open
        return 'checking'
    
    def checking(self):
        self.check_area()
        # If there are any hazards left, start collecting again
        # If not, scan the area again for new hazards
        return 'collecting' if self.detect_hazards() else 'scanning'
    
    def detect_hazards(self):
        # The robot uses this function to identify hazards in the room
        pass
    
    def collect_hazards(self):
        # The robot uses this function to collect hazards
        pass
    
    def arrange_hazards_safely(self):
        # The robot uses this function to arrange hazards safely
        pass
    
    def close_containers(self):
        # The robot uses this function to close opened containers
        pass
    
    def check_area(self):
        # The robot uses this function to check if any hazards were missed
        pass

# Creating an instance of the butler robot with FSM 
Butler = ButlerRobotFSM()

# Start the state machine loop
Butler.run()
```
This class uses states such as 'scanning', 'collecting', 'arranging', 'closing', and 'checking' and uses verbs involved in the FSM actions chosen from your given list. The 'run()' method executes an infinite loop switching between states.
Please note, the functionality of helper methods such as `detect_hazards()`, `collect_hazards()`, `arrange_hazards_safely()`, `close_containers()`, and `check_area()` is abstract and doesn't have an actual implementation.
Each state (method) has a responsibility for a particular set of actions and is responsible for transitioning to the next appropriate state.
