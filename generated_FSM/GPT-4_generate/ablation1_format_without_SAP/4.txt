Here is a basic structure of how the Python class will look. I will create a butler robot with FSM to handle danger in the kitchen. The different states involve: 

- identifying danger
- turning off the stove
- removing flammable items
- opening windows and turning on exhaust fan
- checking the area again for any more threats

Now to convert these into a Python class:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    # Initializing the state machine
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = self.identify_danger
        self.stove_status = True
        self.flammable_items_nearby = True
        self.ventilation_proper = False

    # The state of identifying the danger
    def identify_danger(self):
        if self.stove_status:
            self.turn_off_stove()
        elif self.flammable_items_nearby:
            self.remove_flammable_items()
        elif not self.ventilation_proper:
            self.ventilate_area()
        else:
            self.current_state = self.check_area_again

    # Method to turn off the stove
    def turn_off_stove(self):
        # Turning action here...
        self.stove_status = False

    # Method to remove flammable items
    def remove_flammable_items(self):
        # Transporting oil, dish towel, and cutting board away from the stove...
        self.flammable_items_nearby = False

    # Method to make ventilation proper
    def ventilate_area(self):
        # Opening the window, turning on the extractor fan...
        self.ventilation_proper = True

    # Method to check the area again for any more dangers
    def check_area_again(self):
        # Checking the area, e.g., for gas leaks, other flammable items...
        self.current_state = self.idle

    # The state of doing nothing
    def idle(self):
        pass

    # Method that simulates the Butler Robot's responses
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.current_state()

# Run the FSM
butler_bot_fsm = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_bot_fsm.run()
```

The current_state variable keeps track of the FSM's current state. The bot starts from a state of identifying danger and moves to different states based on identified risks (if the stove is on, if flammable items are nearby, etc.). Helper methods for actions (like turning off the stove, removing flammable items, and ventilating the area) are also present, but they are abstractions in this code. After mitigating all risks, the bot will check the area again before shifting to an idle state, which represents a safe situation where the bot doesn't need to act.

Please note that the code above will result in an infinite loop since the "idle" state does nothing but is active permanently. Further refinements might be required, e.g., by specifying specific exit conditions or providing a system to receive new inputs/events.
