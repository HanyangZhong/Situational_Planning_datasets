Here is the Python code:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    # initial state
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = self.identify_obstacle
        self.is_obstacle_identified = False
        self.is_obstacle_removed = False
    
    # First state: Identify the obstacle
    def identify_obstacle(self):
        self.reaching()  # Assuming this reaches and senses the obstacle
        if self.is_obstacle_identified:
            self.current_state = self.remove_obstacle
        else:
            print("No obstacle identified. Keep monitoring the situation.")
            
    # Second state: Remove the obstacle   
    def remove_obstacle(self):
        self.gripping()  # Assuming this grips the obstacle
        self.lifting()   # Assuming this lifts the obstacle
        self.transporting()  # Assuming this transports the obstacle
        self.lowering()  # Assuming this lowers the obstacle
        if self.is_obstacle_removed:
            self.current_state = self.assist_human
        else:
            print("Obstacle not fully removed, trying again.")
    
    # Third state: Assist the human to move forward
    def assist_human(self):
        self.reminding()  # Reminding the user that the path is now unblocked
        
    # Each action taken by the robot
    def reaching(self):
        self.is_obstacle_identified = True
        print("Obstacle identified.")
        
    def gripping(self):
        print("Gripping the obstacle.")

    def lifting(self):
        print("Lifting the obstacle.")
 
    def transporting(self):
        print("Transporting the obstacle.")

    def lowering(self):
        self.is_obstacle_removed = True
        print("Lowering the obstacle. Path is clear.")

    def reminding(self):
        print("The path towards the desk is clear now. You can move forward.")

    # Main function to run the FSM
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.current_state()
```

Here, the robot identifies the obstacle, removes it and then assists the human to move forward. Each state transition is based on a condition being met - identification of the obstacle triggers transition to the remove obstacle state, and upon successful removal, the robot transitions to the assist human state.
