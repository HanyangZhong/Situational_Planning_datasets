Assuming that a class called "ButlerRobotFSM" will handle the different states for this situation, these states could be as follows:

1. "SCAN_AREA" - Monitor and observe the space and the objects within.
2. "ORGANIZE_TABLE" - Organize the table by cleaning the spilled water and rearranging the scattered items.
3. "SORT_MEDICINES" - Sort the various medication bottles into different categories and refill the weekly pill organizer.
4. "WARN_HUMAN" - Inform the elderly person or their caregiver about disorder and potential mismanagement of medications.

The following is a Python class for these states:

```python 
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = "SCAN_AREA"
        self.achieved = False

    def check_area(self):
        # implementation of checking the area
        if self.current_state == "SCAN_AREA":
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def sort_medicines(self):
        if self.current_state == "SORT_MEDICINES":
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def warn_human(self):
        if self.current_state == "WARN_HUMAN":
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def SCAN_AREA(self):
        print("Scanning area")
        # explain the scenario
        if self.check_area():
            self.current_state = "ORGANIZE_TABLE"

    def ORGANIZE_TABLE(self):
        print("Cleaning table.")
        # implementation of cleaning the table
        self.current_state = "SORT_MEDICINES"

    def SORT_MEDICINES(self):
        print("Sorting medicines.")
        # implementation of sorting medicines
        self.current_state = "WARN_HUMAN"

    def WARN_HUMAN(self):
        print("Warning the person or their caregiver.")
        # implementation of warning the person or their caregiver.
        self.achieved = True

    def transition(self):
        if self.current_state == "SCAN_AREA":
            self.SCAN_AREA()
        elif self.current_state == "ORGANIZE_TABLE":
            self.ORGANIZE_TABLE()
        elif self.current_state == "SORT_MEDICINES":
            self.SORT_MEDICINES()
        elif self.current_state == "WARN_HUMAN":
            self.WARN_HUMAN()

    def run(self):
        while not self.achieved:
            self.transition()
```
In this implementation, each state represents a particular action that the butler robot performs. It first scans the area to gather information. After scanning, it cleans the table and organizes scattered items properly. Then, it sorts different medication bottles and refills the weekly pill organizer, and finally, it informs the elderly person or their caregiver about the mismanagement of medications. This loop will continue until all tasks are accomplished satisfactorily.

Please note that this is a high-level class definition. The implementation of methods to check area, clean table, sort medicines, and warn the person would be filled in according to the project's specific requirements.
