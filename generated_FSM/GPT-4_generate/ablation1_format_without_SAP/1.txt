Each state corresponds to an action needed in the bathroom (mopping, wiping, arranging, hanging), and after each action, the robot goes back to the checking state, to reassess the conditions of the bathroom and decide the next action. The initial condition assumes everything needs cleaning/arranging. For a more complex FSM, conditions to transit between states would be determined by environment observations or sensor inputs.
