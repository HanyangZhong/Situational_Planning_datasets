Sure, let's create a python class called ButlerRobotFSM where the robot's main job is to ensure the safety of the home and especially children who are at risk of getting hurt from dangerous objects such as knives.

Here's the Finite State Machine (FSM):

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initializing the current state to 'monitoring'
        self.current_state = self.monitoring
        self.child_in_danger = False

    def monitoring(self):
        # Monitoring the environment to spot potential hazards
        if self.check_for_danger():
            self.current_state = self.preventing_danger

    def preventing_danger(self):
        # Taking the necessary steps to prevent the danger
        self.reaching_knives()
        self.gripping_knives()
        self.transporting_knives()
        self.placing_down_knives_safely()
        
        # If the danger is prevented, return to monitoring state
        if not self.check_for_danger():
            self.current_state = self.monitoring

    def run(self):
        # Running the state machine
        while True:
            self.current_state()

    def check_for_danger(self):
        # Helper method to check if there's a danger
        if self.child_in_danger:
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def reaching_knives(self):
        # Helper method to reach for the knives
        pass                  # placeholder for actual implementation 
    
    def gripping_knives(self):
        # Helper method to grip the knives
        pass                  # placeholder for actual implementation 

    def transporting_knives(self):
        # Helper method to transport the knives
        pass                  # placeholder for actual implementation 

    def placing_down_knives_safely(self):
        # Helper method to put down the knives safely
        pass                  # placeholder for actual implementation
```

In this class definition, the robot starts in the "monitoring" state. If it detects a danger (i.e., a child reaching for the knives), it transitions to the "preventing_danger" state, where it takes a series of actions to remove the danger. After the danger has been mitigated, the robot returns to the "monitoring" state. The `run()` method carries out the state machine loop.

The helper methods (`reaching_knives, gripping_knives, transporting_knives, placing_down_knives_safely`) are left abstract for now, but in a real implementation, they would contain the lower-level control logic for the robot's actions (like using the robot's motor controls to move its arm and gripper).

Note: The code provided in infinite loop inside the `run()` method. In actual application, there should be a stopping condition or mechanism to break from the infinite loop. For example, a interruption signal from outside or stop the loop at certain conditions such as no dangers detected for a consecutive amount of time.
