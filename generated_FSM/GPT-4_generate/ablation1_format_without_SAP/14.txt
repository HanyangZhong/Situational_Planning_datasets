Here is a python implementation of the scene above as a finite state machine:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = self.monitoring
        self.pet_hazard = False
        self.toxic_food = ['chocolate', 'grapes', 'onions']
        self.toxic_relocated = False

    # Define the monitoring state method
    def monitoring(self):
        self.check_hazard()
        if self.pet_hazard:
            self.current_state = self.removing

    # Define the removing state method
    def removing(self):
        self.collect_toxic_food()
        if self.toxic_relocated:
            self.current_state = self.monitoring
        else:
            self.call_for_help()

    # Helper methods

    # Check for any pet hazard
    def check_hazard(self):
        # Implementation to check for pet hazard
        pass

    # Collect and relocate toxic food
    def collect_toxic_food(self):
        # Implementation to collect toxic food
        pass

    # Making a call for help in case of an issue
    def call_for_help(self):
        # Implementation to call for help
        pass

    # Method to execute the FSM
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.current_state()

```
The class leverages the concepts of finite state machines by defining states as methods within the class, and determining the state transitions within these methods.

The `ButlerRobotFSM` class begins in a "monitoring" state where it is checking for pet hazards. If it detects a pet hazard (i.e., the cat picking interest in the toxic foods on the counter), it transitions to the "removing" state. Here, it tries to remove the toxic foods from the cat's reach by collecting and relocating them. If it's successful, it transitions back to the "monitoring" state. If it fails to remove the toxic foods, it goes into an error state and calls for help.

The run method will keep executing the current state function in a loop, essentially running our state machine.
