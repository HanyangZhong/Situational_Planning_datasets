Based on the scene provided, the robot will perform three main tasks: identifying the mess, cleaning up the spill, and making the kitchen tidy again. Here's a simple FSM implementation for a Butler Robot:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.states = {
            'identify_mess': self.identify_mess,
            'clean_spill': self.clean_spill,
            'arrange_kitchen': self.arrange_kitchen
        }
        self.current_state = 'identify_mess'

    def identify_mess(self):
        # actions: Checking, Monitoring
        checking_the_floor()
        if mess_identified():
            self.current_state = 'clean_spill'

    def clean_spill(self):
        # actions: Reaching, Gripping, Mopping, Lowering, Gripping, Moving, Releasing
        reaching_for_mop()
        gripping_mop()
        mopping_floor()
        releasing_mop()
        if is_floor_clean():
            self.current_state = 'arrange_kitchen'

    def arrange_kitchen(self):
        # actions: Picking up, Checking, Placing down, Arranging
        picking_up_bottle_and_pot()
        checking_kitchen_counter()
        placing_down_bottle_and_pot()
        arranging_kitchen_counter()
        if is_kitchen_arranged():
            self.current_state = 'identify_mess'

    def checking_the_floor(self):
        pass

    def reaching_for_mop(self):
        pass

    def gripping_mop(self):
        pass

    def mopping_floor(self):
        pass

    def releasing_mop(self):
        pass

    def is_floor_clean(self):
        pass

    def picking_up_bottle_and_pot(self):
        pass

    def placing_down_bottle_and_pot(self):
        pass

    def checking_kitchen_counter(self):
        pass

    def arranging_kitchen_counter(self):
        pass

    def is_kitchen_arranged(self):
        pass

    def run(self):
        while True:
            state_function = self.states[self.current_state]
            state_function()
```

In this code, state methods correspond to the different states the robot might have, and the actions it needs to take when in that state. These actions are represented as helper methods like `checking_the_floor, reaching_for_mop`, etc. The robot starts in the 'identify_mess' state, and based on the conditions checked after performing certain actions, transitions to the next state. This loop continues until the kitchen is clean and arranged.
