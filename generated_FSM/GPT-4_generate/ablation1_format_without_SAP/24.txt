The FSM operates as follows: 

Initially, the robot is in the monitoring_scene state where it's watching the child and the playroom. If it detects a choking hazard toy near the child, it transitions into the reaching_toy state. 

In the reaching_toy state, the robot extends its arm to grip the toy. Once it has a firm grip on the toy, it transitions into the removing_toy state. 

In the removing_toy state, the robot transports the toy away from the child's vicinity, placing it in a secured container or high shelf. Once the toy is removed, it reverts back to the monitoring_scene state, ready to detect further potential choking risks.

The run() method ensures the FSM operates continuously, actively surveiling and making the playroom safe for the child.

Please note that this is a skeleton implementation of the FSM. Real-world implementation may need more detailed states, error handling, and additional safety measures to ensure the child's safety.
