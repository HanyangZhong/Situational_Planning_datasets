Here's a class definition that fits your criteria:

```python

        self.flame_near_book = self.check_candle_placement()
        if self.flame_near_book:
            self.current_state = self.reaching_candle
        else:
            self.current_state = self.maintaining_position

    def maintaining_position(self):
        '''State of maintaining position and continuously monitoring the room'''

        pass

    def grip_candle(self):
        '''Grips the candle'''
        
        # Here would be an algorithm to grip the candle
        pass

    def transport_candle(self):

        pass
      
    def run(self):
        '''Execute the state machine loop of the Butler Robot FSM'''
        
        while True:
            self.current_state()
```  

This code defines `ButlerRobotFSM` class with several states, transitioning depending on whether the candle is dangerously close to the books. Helper methods are not fully implemented and should be replaced with real logic depending on specific scenarios. The `run()` method starts the state machine in an infinite loop.
