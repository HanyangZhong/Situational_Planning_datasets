To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described scenario, we will define several states that represent the robot's actions in assisting the disabled person. The states will be based on the given scene and the list of verbs provided. Here's a Python code example:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'CHECK_PERSON': self.check_person_state,
            'REACH_BUTTON': self.reach_button_state,
            'PRESS_BUTTON': self.press_button_state,
            'ASSIST_PERSON': self.assist_person_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial assessment of the situation.
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_PERSON'

    def check_person_state(self):
        # Check on the person's condition.
        if self.is_person_unresponsive():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'REACH_BUTTON'

    def reach_button_state(self):
        # Reach for the emergency alert button.
        self.reaching('emergency button')
        self.current_state = 'PRESS_BUTTON'

    def press_button_state(self):
        # Press the emergency alert button.
        self.pressing('emergency button')
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_PERSON'

    def assist_person_state(self):
        # Assist the person back into their wheelchair or to a safe position.
        self.lifting('person')
        self.placing_down('person', 'safe position')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for additional help if the person is unresponsive.
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Monitor the person until help arrives.
        self.monitoring('person', 'until help arrives')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Placeholder action methods (to be implemented)
    def reaching(self, target):
        pass

    def pressing(self, target):
        pass

    def lifting(self, target):
        pass

    def placing_down(self, target, location):
        pass

    def calling_for_help(self):
        pass

    def monitoring(self, target, condition):
        pass

    def is_person_unresponsive(self):
        # Method to check if the person is unresponsive
        # Placeholder logic
        return False

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            action = self.states[self.current_state]
            action()

# Create an instance of the butler robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code outlines a basic FSM for a butler robot in a situation where a disabled person needs assistance. Each state corresponds to a specific action the robot should take, and the transitions between states are based on the situation's assessment. The actual implementation of methods like `reaching`, `pressing`, `lifting`, etc., would depend on the robot's physical capabilities and sensors.
