To design a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot that addresses the described cluttered hallway scenario, we'll first identify the key tasks the robot must perform. These tasks include assessing the situation, clearing the hallway, ensuring safety, and monitoring for any additional hazards. The FSM will transition between states based on these tasks, using the provided verbs for actions.

Here's a Python implementation:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CLEAR_HALLWAY': self.clear_hallway_state,
            'ENSURE_SAFETY': self.ensure_safety_state,
            'MONITOR_HALLWAY': self.monitor_hallway_state,
            'COMPLETED': self.completed_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state where the robot starts
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation in the hallway
        # If clutter is detected, move to CLEAR_HALLWAY state
        if self.detect_clutter():
            self.current_state = 'CLEAR_HALLWAY'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def clear_hallway_state(self):
        # Clear the clutter from the hallway
        self.collecting('items')
        self.placing_down('items', 'appropriate places')
        self.adjusting('rug')
        # Once cleared, move to ENSURE_SAFETY state
        self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def ensure_safety_state(self):
        # Ensure that the hallway is safe
        self.checking('hallway for safety')
        # Once safety is ensured, move to MONITOR_HALLWAY state
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_HALLWAY'

    def monitor_hallway_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the hallway for any new hazards
        if self.detect_new_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'CLEAR_HALLWAY'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'COMPLETED'

    def completed_state(self):
        # Completed clearing and ensuring safety
        # End of the FSM loop
        pass

    # Helper methods for actions and condition checks
    def detect_clutter(self):
        # Implementation to detect clutter in the hallway
        return True  # Example condition

    def detect_new_hazards(self):
        # Implementation to detect new hazards
        return False  # Example condition

    def collecting(self, items):
        # Implementation of collecting action
        pass

    def placing_down(self, items, location):
        # Implementation of placing down action
        pass

    def adjusting(self, item):
        # Implementation of adjusting action
        pass

    def checking(self, area):
        # Implementation of checking action
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while self.current_state != 'COMPLETED':
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance and run the FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, the robot starts by assessing the situation. If clutter is detected, it moves to the `CLEAR_HALLWAY` state to remove obstacles and tidy up. Once the hallway is clear, it ensures safety by checking for any remaining hazards. The robot then continuously monitors the hallway in the `MONITOR_HALLWAY` state and repeats the clearing process if new hazards are detected. The FSM ends when the hallway is deemed safe and no further actions are needed.
