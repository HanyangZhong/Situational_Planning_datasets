To create a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Python for a butler robot that is tasked with addressing a bathroom scene after a shower has been used, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify the states**: Each state represents a specific task or action the robot needs to perform.
2. **Define transitions**: Transitions dictate how the robot moves from one state to another based on certain conditions or actions completed.
3. **Implement actions**: Define the specific actions (from the provided verbs list) the robot will perform in each state.

Given the scene description, the states might include assessing the situation, tidying the bathroom, addressing safety hazards, and returning to a standby state. Here's an example FSM in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define states as methods
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'TIDY_BATHROOM': self.tidy_bathroom_state,
            'ADDRESS_SAFETY_HAZARDS': self.address_safety_hazards_state,
            'STANDBY': self.standby_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state, transition to assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the bathroom situation
        if self.is_bathroom_messy():
            self.current_state = 'TIDY_BATHROOM'
        elif self.is_safety_hazard_present():
            self.current_state = 'ADDRESS_SAFETY_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'STANDBY'

    def tidy_bathroom_state(self):
        # Tidy up the bathroom
        self.folding('towel')
        self.placing_down('bath mat')
        self.wiping('water droplets')
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def address_safety_hazards_state(self):
        # Address any safety hazards
        self.arranging('bath mat')
        self.drying('floor')
        self.current_state = 'STANDBY'

    def standby_state(self):
        # Standby state, wait for further instructions or reassess
        self.monitoring('bathroom')
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    # Helper methods for conditions
    def is_bathroom_messy(self):
        # Check if the bathroom is messy
        return True  # Placeholder logic

    def is_safety_hazard_present(self):
        # Check for any safety hazards
        return True  # Placeholder logic

    # Actions
    def folding(self, item):
        print(f"Folding {item}")

    def placing_down(self, item):
        print(f"Placing down {item}")

    def wiping(self, item):
        print(f"Wiping {item}")

    def arranging(self, item):
        print(f"Arranging {item}")

    def drying(self, item):
        print(f"Drying {item}")

    def monitoring(self, area):
        print(f"Monitoring {area}")

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code sets up a basic FSM for the butler robot. Each state corresponds to a specific task or set of tasks the robot should perform in the bathroom scenario. The `run` method continuously executes the FSM, allowing the robot to transition between states based on the conditions defined in each state's method. The helper methods (`is_bathroom_messy`, `is_safety_hazard_present`) and action methods (like `folding`, `placing_down`) are placeholders and should be implemented with actual logic and actions the robot can perform.
