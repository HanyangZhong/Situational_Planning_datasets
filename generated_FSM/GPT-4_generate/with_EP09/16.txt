To create a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described kitchen scene, we need to define states and transitions that specifically address the situation of a child potentially reaching for dangerous objects. Here's an example of how this could be structured in Python:

```python
class KitchenSafetyRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'PREVENT_DANGER': self.prevent_danger_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Start with assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Check if the child is reaching for dangerous objects
        if self.is_child_reaching_dangerous_objects():
            self.current_state = 'PREVENT_DANGER'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def prevent_danger_state(self):
        # Take action to prevent the child from reaching dangerous objects
        self.removing('sharp objects', 'from reach')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage with the child to distract them from the danger
        self.engaging('child', 'safe activity')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation for any potential danger
        if self.is_child_reaching_dangerous_objects():
            self.current_state = 'PREVENT_DANGER'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation becomes unmanageable
        self.calling('for human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for various actions and checks
    def is_child_reaching_dangerous_objects(self):
        # Implement logic to detect if the child is reaching for dangerous objects
        # Placeholder logic
        return True

    def removing(self, object, location):
        # Implement logic to remove objects from reach
        pass

    def engaging(self, entity, activity):
        # Implement logic to engage with the child
        pass

    def calling(self, request):
        # Implement logic to call for help
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
kitchen_safety_robot = KitchenSafetyRobotFSM()
kitchen_safety_robot.run()
```

In this FSM:
- The robot starts by assessing the situation.
- If the child is reaching for dangerous objects, it moves to prevent danger by removing these objects.
- Then, the robot engages the child with a safe activity.
- It continuously monitors the situation and repeats the cycle if necessary.
- There is also a provision to call for human help if the situation escalates beyond the robot's capability to handle.
