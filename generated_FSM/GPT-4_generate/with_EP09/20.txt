Based on your description and the example code, I'll create a finite state machine (FSM) for a hypothetical butler robot designed to assist in the described living room scene. The FSM will follow the steps necessary to help the elderly person in distress and ensure their safety. 

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REACH_DEVICE': self.reach_device_state,
            'ASSIST_ELDERLY': self.assist_elderly_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state
        }
        # Set initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state to start assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation to decide the next action
        if self.elderly_in_distress() and self.device_out_of_reach():
            self.current_state = 'REACH_DEVICE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def reach_device_state(self):
        # Reach for the emergency response device
        self.reaching('emergency device')
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_ELDERLY'

    def assist_elderly_state(self):
        # Assist the elderly person
        if self.elderly_needs_immediate_help():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for additional help if required
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation
        if self.elderly_in_distress():
            self.current_state = 'ASSIST_ELDERLY'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper functions to determine state transitions
    def elderly_in_distress(self):
        # Check if the elderly person is in distress
        return self.checking('elderly person')

    def device_out_of_reach(self):
        # Check if the device is out of reach
        return self.checking('emergency device position')

    def elderly_needs_immediate_help(self):
        # Determine if the elderly person needs immediate assistance
        return self.checking('elderly person immediate needs')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Action to call for help
        self.calling('emergency services')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code represents a basic structure of a finite state machine for the butler robot. Each state is defined with conditions that lead to transitions to other states, based on the situation in the room and the needs of the elderly person. The `run` method continuously executes the current state's method, allowing the robot to respond to changes in the environment. The helper functions like `elderly_in_distress`, `device_out_of_reach`, etc., would contain the logic to assess the specific conditions they're named after.
