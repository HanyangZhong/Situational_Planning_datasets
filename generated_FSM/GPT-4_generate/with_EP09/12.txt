To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described living room scene, we'll follow the structure of the provided example but tailor the states and actions to the specific context. In this scene, the primary concern is the pregnant woman's safety as she navigates through a cluttered room with potential tripping hazards. The FSM will involve states such as assessing the situation, clearing hazards, monitoring the woman's movement, and calling for help if necessary.

Here's the Python code for this scenario:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CLEAR_HAZARDS': self.clear_hazards_state,
            'MONITOR_MOVEMENT': self.monitor_movement_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state, start with situation assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess room for potential hazards
        if self.are_hazards_present():
            self.current_state = 'CLEAR_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_MOVEMENT'

    def clear_hazards_state(self):
        # Clear hazards such as toys, magazines, and curled rug edges
        self.collecting('hazards')
        self.placing_down('hazards', 'safe location')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_MOVEMENT'

    def monitor_movement_state(self):
        # Monitor the woman's movement for safety
        if self.is_woman_in_danger():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if necessary
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and conditions
    def are_hazards_present(self):
        # Check for hazards in the room
        return self.checking('room hazards')

    def is_woman_in_danger(self):
        # Monitor the woman's safety
        return self.monitoring('woman', 'safety')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Action to call for help
        self.calling('emergency services')

    # Main loop to run the FSM
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code establishes a basic FSM for a butler robot in a specific scenario, focusing on the safety and assistance of a pregnant woman in a potentially hazardous living room. The states and actions are based on the situation's requirements, using verbs from the provided list and following proper Python syntax and conventions.
