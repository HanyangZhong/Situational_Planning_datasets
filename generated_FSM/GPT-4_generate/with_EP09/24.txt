Based on your description of the playroom scene and the verbs provided, I will create a finite state machine (FSM) in Python code for a butler robot designed to ensure the safety of a child in a playroom environment. The FSM will include states and transitions relevant to this specific scenario, focusing on preventing choking hazards and maintaining a safe play environment.

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_HAZARDS': self.remove_hazards_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state of the butler robot.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the playroom for potential hazards.
        if self.detect_choking_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def remove_hazards_state(self):
        # Remove small toys that pose choking hazards.
        self.collecting('small toys')
        self.placing_down('small toys', 'safe storage')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage the child with safe toys.
        self.delivering('safe toys', 'child')
        self.reminding('child', 'safe play practices')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child's play for safety.
        if self.detect_dangerous_behavior():
            self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'
        elif self.is_emergency_situation():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # In case of an emergency, call for human assistance.
        self.calling_for_help('emergency services')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and assessments
    def detect_choking_hazards(self):
        # Code to detect small toys that are choking hazards
        return True  # Placeholder

    def detect_dangerous_behavior(self):
        # Code to detect dangerous behavior by the child
        return False  # Placeholder

    def is_emergency_situation(self):
        # Code to determine if an emergency situation has occurred
        return False  # Placeholder

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the Butler Robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code defines a FSM with states and transitions tailored to the scenario of a butler robot in a playroom with a child. Each state represents a specific task or observation mode, and transitions are based on the assessment of the environment and the child's behavior. The robot's primary objectives are to ensure the child's safety by removing choking hazards, engaging the child with safe activities, and monitoring the play environment.
