To design a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in a scenario involving a messy laundry room with potentially hazardous cleaning products, we need to define the states and the transitions based on the actions the robot should take. The FSM will follow the logic of assessing the situation, taking appropriate actions to mitigate any hazards, and ensuring safety in the environment. Here's a Python implementation of such an FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define states
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_HAZARDS': self.secure_hazards_state,
            'CLEAN_UP': self.clean_up_state,
            'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT': self.monitor_environment_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: Start with assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation for any immediate hazards
        if self.hazards_present():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def secure_hazards_state(self):
        # Secure any immediate hazards (e.g., uncapped bleach)
        self.cap_chemicals()
        self.upright_spilled_containers()
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_UP'

    def clean_up_state(self):
        # Clean up any spills or hazards
        self.wiping('spills')
        self.collecting('hazardous materials')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def monitor_environment_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the environment for safety
        if self.new_hazards_detected():
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation is beyond the robot's capability
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and conditions
    def hazards_present(self):
        # Check for hazards in the environment
        return self.checking('environment for hazards')

    def cap_chemicals(self):
        # Secure uncapped chemicals
        self.closing('chemical containers')

    def upright_spilled_containers(self):
        # Upright any tipped over containers
        self.placing_down('spilled containers')

    def new_hazards_detected(self):
        # Check for new hazards
        return self.monitoring('environment for new hazards')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.calling('for human assistance')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, the robot initially assesses the situation, takes steps to secure any hazards, cleans up any mess, and continuously monitors the environment. It can also call for help if the situation requires human intervention. Each state is responsible for transitioning to the next appropriate state based on the conditions and actions performed.
