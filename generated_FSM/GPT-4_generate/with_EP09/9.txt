To design a finite state machine (FSM) in Python for a butler robot dealing with the described scenario, we need to create states that reflect the various tasks the robot must perform to manage the medication and tidy the living area. We will use the verbs provided to define actions within each state. Here's an example:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_MEDICATION': self.assess_medication_state,
            'ORGANIZE_MEDICATION': self.organize_medication_state,
            'CLEAN_AREA': self.clean_area_state,
            'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT': self.monitor_environment_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial assessment of the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_MEDICATION'

    def assess_medication_state(self):
        # Assess the medication management situation
        if self.is_medication_mismanaged():
            self.current_state = 'ORGANIZE_MEDICATION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CLEAN_AREA'

    def organize_medication_state(self):
        # Organize the medication
        self.collecting('medication bottles')
        self.arranging('medication in organizer')
        self.reminding('elderly person', 'medication schedule')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_AREA'

    def clean_area_state(self):
        # Clean the living area
        self.collecting('spilled items')
        self.wiping('table')
        self.folding('newspaper')
        self.placing_down('items in order')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def monitor_environment_state(self):
        # Monitor the environment for any further disarray or needs
        if self.needs_assistance():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if necessary
        self.calling_for_help('human caregiver')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper functions for conditions and actions
    def is_medication_mismanaged(self):
        # Implement the logic to determine if medication is mismanaged
        return True  # Placeholder

    def needs_assistance(self):
        # Implement logic to determine if additional help is needed
        return False  # Placeholder

    def calling_for_help(self, recipient):
        # Implement the action of calling for help
        pass  # Placeholder

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code creates a FSM for a butler robot, with states for assessing the situation, organizing medication, cleaning the area, monitoring the environment, and calling for help. The transitions between states are based on conditions like medication mismanagement and the need for assistance. Helper functions and placeholders are used for specific actions and conditions, which should be implemented based on the actual capabilities and sensors of the robot.
