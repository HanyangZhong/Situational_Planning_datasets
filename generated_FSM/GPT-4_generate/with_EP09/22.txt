Based on your scenario and requirements, I'll create a Python Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot in a situation where a pregnant woman has fallen and needs assistance. The FSM will include states relevant to this scenario, utilizing the actions you've provided in your list. 

Here's a Python code example:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REACH_ALERT_BUTTON': self.reach_alert_button_state,
            'ASSIST_WOMAN': self.assist_woman_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: Start with assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if the woman needs immediate assistance
        if self.detects_fallen_person():
            self.current_state = 'REACH_ALERT_BUTTON'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def reach_alert_button_state(self):
        # Reach for the emergency alert button
        self.reaching('emergency alert button')
        self.pressing('emergency alert button')
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_WOMAN'

    def assist_woman_state(self):
        # Assist the fallen woman
        self.monitoring('womanâ€™s condition')
        self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.calling_for_help('emergency services')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation and reassess if needed
        if self.detects_change_in_situation():
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Helper methods
    def detects_fallen_person(self):
        # Detect if a person has fallen
        return self.checking('fallen person')

    def reaching(self, target):
        # Reach for an item
        self.extending_arm(target)

    def pressing(self, button):
        # Press a button
        self.pushing(button)

    def monitoring(self, target):
        # Monitor a person's condition
        return self.observing(target)

    def calling_for_help(self, service):
        # Call for help
        self.dialing(service)

    def detects_change_in_situation(self):
        # Detect any change in the situation
        return self.scanning('environment')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code implements a basic FSM with states and actions tailored to the specific scenario you provided. Each state represents a different phase of the robot's response, and the actions (like reaching, pressing, monitoring) are based on your provided verbs. The robot continuously assesses the situation and acts accordingly. The helper methods (like `detects_fallen_person`, `reaching`, etc.) are placeholders for the actual implementation of these actions.
