Based on the provided scenario and the example code structure, I'll create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in a situation where it needs to deal with a potentially hazardous candle on a bookshelf. The FSM will follow proper Python syntax, include explanatory comments, and use verbs from the provided list.

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the states of the robot
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REACHING_CANDLE': self.reaching_candle_state,
            'EXTINGUISH_FLAME': self.extinguish_flame_state,
            'REMOVING_CANDLE': self.removing_candle_state,
            'CHECKING_FOR_DANGER': self.checking_for_danger_state,
            'CALLING_FOR_HELP': self.calling_for_help_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state where the robot starts its operation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation: check if the candle is a fire hazard
        if self.is_candle_a_hazard():
            self.current_state = 'REACHING_CANDLE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CHECKING_FOR_DANGER'

    def reaching_candle_state(self):
        # Reach towards the candle carefully
        self.reaching('candle')
        self.current_state = 'EXTINGUISH_FLAME'

    def extinguish_flame_state(self):
        # Extinguish the candle flame safely
        self.blowing_out('candle flame')
        self.current_state = 'REMOVING_CANDLE'

    def removing_candle_state(self):
        # Safely remove the candle from the bookshelf
        self.grasping('candle')
        self.placing_down('candle', 'safe location')
        self.current_state = 'CHECKING_FOR_DANGER'

    def checking_for_danger_state(self):
        # Check for any remaining dangers in the room
        if self.is_danger_still_present():
            self.current_state = 'CALLING_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def calling_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if danger persists
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and checks
    def is_candle_a_hazard(self):
        # Check if the candle poses a fire hazard
        return True  # This is a placeholder, real implementation needed

    def is_danger_still_present(self):
        # Check if there's any other danger in the room
        return False  # This is a placeholder, real implementation needed

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Method to call for help
        pass  # Implement calling for help logic

    def blowing_out(self, target):
        # Method to blow out the candle
        pass  # Implement blowing out logic

# Create an instance of the robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code outlines the basic structure and logic for the butler robot's FSM. In a real-world implementation, the methods like `is_candle_a_hazard`, `blowing_out`, and others would need more detailed implementations based on the robot's capabilities and sensors.
