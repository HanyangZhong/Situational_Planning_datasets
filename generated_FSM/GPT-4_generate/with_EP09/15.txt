To create a finite state machine (FSM) in Python for a butler robot operating in the described living room scenario, we'll follow these steps:

1. Define states that represent the various tasks or conditions the robot might encounter.
2. Define transitions between states based on the conditions or actions completed.
3. Implement methods that correspond to the actions the robot can perform, using the verbs provided.
4. Include a method to run the FSM, which will repeatedly check and change the state based on the current conditions.

Let's code this FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'CHECK_HAZARDS': self.check_hazards_state,
            'FIX_OUTLET_HAZARD': self.fix_outlet_hazard_state,
            'MOVE_TOXIC_PLANT': self.move_toxic_plant_state,
            'REMOVE_TOY_HAZARD': self.remove_toy_hazard_state,
            'MONITOR_ROOM': self.monitor_room_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state to start the hazard checking process
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_HAZARDS'

    def check_hazards_state(self):
        # Check for various hazards in the room
        if self.is_outlet_unsafe():
            self.current_state = 'FIX_OUTLET_HAZARD'
        elif self.is_toxic_plant_reachable():
            self.current_state = 'MOVE_TOXIC_PLANT'
        elif self.is_toy_hazard_present():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_TOY_HAZARD'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ROOM'

    def fix_outlet_hazard_state(self):
        # Secure the electrical outlet
        self.covering('electrical outlet')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_HAZARDS'

    def move_toxic_plant_state(self):
        # Move the toxic plant to a safe location
        self.lifting('potted plant')
        self.placing_down('potted plant', 'higher shelf')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_HAZARDS'

    def remove_toy_hazard_state(self):
        # Remove the small toy with detachable parts
        self.collecting('small toy')
        self.storing('small toy', 'safe location')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_HAZARDS'

    def monitor_room_state(self):
        # Monitor the room and ensure everything is safe
        self.monitoring('room', 'safety')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_HAZARDS'

    # Helper methods for checking conditions
    def is_outlet_unsafe(self):
        # Check if the electrical outlet is unsafe
        return self.checking('electrical outlet', 'safety')

    def is_toxic_plant_reachable(self):
        # Check if the toxic plant is within reach of pets
        return self.checking('potted plant', 'accessibility')

    def is_toy_hazard_present(self):
        # Check for small toys that could be choking hazards
        return self.checking('small toy', 'hazard presence')

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the Butler Robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, the robot starts in an initial state, then checks for various hazards in the living room, such as an unsafe outlet, a toxic plant, or a toy that poses a choking hazard. Depending on what it finds, the robot transitions to the appropriate state to mitigate the hazard, then returns to monitoring the room for safety. Each state involves specific actions tailored to the situation.
