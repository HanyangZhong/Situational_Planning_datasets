In the provided scenario, a butler robot would need to assist a person suffering from a headache who is unable to reach their medicine. To implement this as a finite state machine (FSM) in Python, we'll define a class `ButlerRobotFSM` with various states tailored to this specific situation. The FSM will guide the robot through a sequence of actions like assessing the situation, reaching for the medicine, and delivering it to the person. We'll use the verbs provided for defining these actions.

Here is an example of how such a Python class could be structured:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REACH_MEDICINE': self.reach_medicine_state,
            'DELIVER_MEDICINE': self.deliver_medicine_state,
            'MONITOR_PATIENT': self.monitor_patient_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: start with assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the patient's condition and location of medicine
        if self.is_patient_unable_to_reach_medicine():
            self.current_state = 'REACH_MEDICINE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PATIENT'

    def reach_medicine_state(self):
        # Reach for the medicine
        self.reaching('medicine bottle')
        self.grasping('medicine bottle')
        self.current_state = 'DELIVER_MEDICINE'

    def deliver_medicine_state(self):
        # Deliver the medicine to the patient
        self.transporting('medicine bottle', 'to patient')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PATIENT'

    def monitor_patient_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the patient's condition
        if self.is_patient_in_distress():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation is beyond the robot's capability
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and conditions
    def is_patient_unable_to_reach_medicine(self):
        # Check if the patient is unable to reach the medicine
        return self.checking('patient', 'medicine accessibility')

    def is_patient_in_distress(self):
        # Monitor patient's condition for any distress
        return self.monitoring('patient', 'health condition')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Action for calling human assistance
        self.calling('human assistance', 'patient in distress')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the butler robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, the robot starts in the `INITIAL` state, assesses the situation, reaches for the medicine if needed, delivers it to the patient, monitors the patient, and calls for help if the situation is critical. The helper methods (`is_patient_unable_to_reach_medicine`, `is_patient_in_distress`, and `calling_for_help`) would contain the specific logic or sensors' data processing to make decisions and perform actions.
