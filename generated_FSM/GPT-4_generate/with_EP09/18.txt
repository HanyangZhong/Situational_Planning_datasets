To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described scenario, we need to define states and transitions that will guide the robot's actions to ensure the child's safety. We'll use the given verbs for the robot's actions and focus on the situation where the child is near an uncovered electrical outlet.

Here's a Python implementation of such an FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define states
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_DANGER': self.remove_danger_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Start with assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Check if child is in danger
        if self.is_child_near_danger():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_DANGER'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def remove_danger_state(self):
        # Remove any dangerous objects or block access to the outlet
        self.blocking('outlet')
        # Engage with the child to distract from the danger
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Offer safe play alternatives
        self.presenting('safe toys', 'child')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child's activities
        if self.is_child_safe():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation is beyond the robot's control
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods
    def is_child_near_danger(self):
        # Check if the child is near the electrical outlet
        return self.checking('child', 'electrical outlet')

    def blocking(self, object):
        # Block access to the dangerous object
        self.inserting('safety cover', object)

    def presenting(self, item, to):
        # Present safe items to the child
        self.delivering(item, to)

    def is_child_safe(self):
        # Monitor the child's safety
        return self.monitoring('child', 'safety')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.calling('human help')

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code provides a structured approach to handling the scenario with the child and the electrical outlet. The FSM transitions between states based on the situation, ensuring the child's safety by removing danger, engaging the child with safe alternatives, and monitoring the situation continuously. If needed, it also calls for human assistance.
