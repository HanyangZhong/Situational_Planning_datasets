To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described scene, we need to define states and transitions that align with the robot's tasks. The robot's primary objective is to assist the wheelchair user by removing the obstruction caused by the office chair. Here's how the FSM could be structured:

1. **Initial State:** The robot starts in an initial state where it needs to assess the situation.
2. **Assess Situation:** The robot assesses the room and identifies the obstacle.
3. **Remove Obstacle:** The robot performs actions to remove the obstacle, which is the office chair in this case.
4. **Verify Path Clearance:** After removing the obstacle, the robot needs to ensure that the path is clear for the wheelchair user.
5. **Await Further Instructions:** Once the path is clear, the robot waits for any further instructions from the user.
6. **Call for Help:** If the robot encounters a situation it cannot handle, it should call for help.

Each state involves certain actions that the robot will perform, and these actions are selected from the provided list of verbs. Let's write the Python code for this FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_OBSTACLE': self.remove_obstacle_state,
            'VERIFY_PATH_CLEARANCE': self.verify_path_clearance_state,
            'AWAIT_FURTHER_INSTRUCTIONS': self.await_further_instructions_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: start by assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation in the room
        if self.detect_obstacle():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_OBSTACLE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'AWAIT_FURTHER_INSTRUCTIONS'

    def remove_obstacle_state(self):
        # Remove the obstacle (office chair) from the wheelchair user's path
        self.gripping('office chair')
        self.dragging('office chair', 'to a suitable location')
        self.current_state = 'VERIFY_PATH_CLEARANCE'

    def verify_path_clearance_state(self):
        # Ensure that the path is clear for the wheelchair user
        if self.is_path_clear():
            self.current_state = 'AWAIT_FURTHER_INSTRUCTIONS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def await_further_instructions_state(self):
        # Wait for any further instructions from the user
        self.monitoring('user requests')
        # Loop back to the initial state to reassess the situation
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the task cannot be completed
        self.calling('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and checks
    def detect_obstacle(self):
        # Method to detect if there is an obstacle in the room
        return True  # Simplified for illustration

    def is_path_clear(self):
        # Check if the path is clear
        return True  # Simplified for illustration

    def gripping(self, item):
        print(f"Gripping {item}")

    def dragging(self, item, location):
        print(f"Dragging {item} to {location}")

    def monitoring(self, item):
        print(f"Monitoring {item}")

    def calling(self, assistance):
        print(f"Calling for {assistance}")

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, the robot transitions between states based on the situation in the room and the tasks it needs to perform. The actions like gripping, dragging, monitoring, and calling are represented as methods within the class, and can be implemented with more detailed logic as needed.
