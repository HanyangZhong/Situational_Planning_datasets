Based on the scenario you described and the example provided, I will create a Python code for a Butler Robot Finite State Machine (FSM) designed to safely manage a situation where a small child is playing roughly with a large dog in a living room. The FSM will use the verbs you provided and include comments for clarity.

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the FSM with various states
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CALM_DOG': self.calm_dog_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state where the robot starts
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the play situation between the child and the dog
        if self.is_play_too_rough():
            self.current_state = 'CALM_DOG'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def calm_dog_state(self):
        # Calm the dog to ensure child's safety
        self.distracting('dog', 'calming toy')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage the child with safe activities
        self.collecting('safe toys')
        self.delivering('safe toys', 'child')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child and dog's play
        if self.is_safety_at_risk():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        elif self.is_play_safe():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance in case of safety risk
        self.calling_for_help('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for decision making and actions
    def is_play_too_rough(self):
        # Check if the play is too rough
        return self.monitoring('child', 'dog', 'play intensity')

    def is_safety_at_risk(self):
        # Determine if the safety is at risk
        return self.monitoring('child', 'dog', 'safety risk')

    def is_play_safe(self):
        # Assess if the play is now safe
        return self.monitoring('child', 'dog', 'safe play')

    def distracting(self, target, tool):
        # Use a tool to distract the target
        self.reaching(tool)
        self.delivering(tool, target)

    def calling_for_help(self, target):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.calling(target)

    # Main loop to run the FSM
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, the robot initially assesses the situation, then takes steps to calm the dog and engage the child with safe activities. It continuously monitors the play and is prepared to call for help if the situation becomes unsafe. The helper methods (`is_play_too_rough`, `is_safety_at_risk`, `is_play_safe`, etc.) would contain the logic to assess the situation based on the robot's sensors and programming.
