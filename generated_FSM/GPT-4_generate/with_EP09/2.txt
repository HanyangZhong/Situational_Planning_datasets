Creating a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot to handle the described kitchen scene involves defining a set of states and the transitions between these states based on the actions taken by the robot. I will use the verbs provided to define the actions in each state. 

Here's a Python implementation of such an FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CLEAN_SPILL': self.clean_spill_state,
            'REMOVE_HAZARD': self.remove_hazard_state,
            'CHECK_ENVIRONMENT': self.check_environment_state,
            'FINISH_CLEANING': self.finish_cleaning_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state, transitioning to situation assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the kitchen situation, especially the spill
        spill_detected = self.checking('spill')
        if spill_detected:
            self.current_state = 'CLEAN_SPILL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CHECK_ENVIRONMENT'

    def clean_spill_state(self):
        # Clean the spill using appropriate tools
        self.grasping('mop')
        self.mopping('spill area')
        self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARD'

    def remove_hazard_state(self):
        # Remove any additional hazards, like the overturned bottle
        self.grasping('overturned bottle')
        self.placing_down('bottle', 'safe place')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_ENVIRONMENT'

    def check_environment_state(self):
        # Ensure the environment is safe and tidy
        self.sweeping('kitchen floor')
        self.current_state = 'FINISH_CLEANING'

    def finish_cleaning_state(self):
        # Final state - finishing up the cleaning process
        self.arranging('utensils')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods to simulate actions
    def checking(self, item):
        return True  # Simplified for example purposes

    def grasping(self, item):
        pass

    def mopping(self, area):
        pass

    def placing_down(self, item, location):
        pass

    def sweeping(self, area):
        pass

    def arranging(self, items):
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            state_function = self.states[self.current_state]
            state_function()

# Create an instance of the butler robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code models a basic FSM for a butler robot in a kitchen scenario. The robot starts in an initial state, assesses the situation, cleans the spill, removes additional hazards, checks the environment, and finishes the cleaning process. The `while True` loop in the `run` method keeps the FSM running indefinitely, cycling through the states as needed. The helper methods (`checking`, `grasping`, etc.) are placeholders for the actual actions the robot would perform and are simplified for this example.
