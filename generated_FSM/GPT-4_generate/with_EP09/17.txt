To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in a scenario where a young child is close to a dangerous staircase, we'll define states and transitions relevant to this specific situation. The verbs from the provided list will be used to define actions within each state. Here's an example of how the FSM could be structured in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'RESCUE_CHILD': self.rescue_child_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: start with assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the child's proximity to the staircase
        if self.is_child_near_staircase():
            self.current_state = 'RESCUE_CHILD'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def rescue_child_state(self):
        # Rescue the child from the dangerous situation
        self.grasping('child gently')
        self.transporting('child', 'safe area')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation for safety
        if self.is_child_in_danger():
            self.current_state = 'RESCUE_CHILD'
        elif self.is_help_needed():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance in case of emergency
        self.calling_for_help('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for conditions and actions
    def is_child_near_staircase(self):
        # Check if the child is near the staircase
        return self.checking('child', 'staircase proximity')

    def is_child_in_danger(self):
        # Assess if the child is in danger
        return self.monitoring('child', 'danger')

    def is_help_needed(self):
        # Determine if additional help is needed
        return self.evaluating('situation', 'need for assistance')

    def calling_for_help(self, assistance):
        # Action to call for help
        self.calling(assistance)

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the butler robot and run the FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM:
- **INITIAL** state begins the process by moving to the **ASSESS_SITUATION** state.
- **ASSESS_SITUATION** checks if the child is near the staircase. If so, it transitions to **RESCUE_CHILD**, otherwise to **MONITOR_SITUATION**.
- **RESCUE_CHILD** involves actions to safely move the child away from danger.
- **MONITOR_SITUATION** continuously checks for danger and can transition to **RESCUE_CHILD** or **CALL_FOR_HELP** as needed.
- **CALL_FOR_HELP** is used in emergency situations requiring human intervention.

The helper methods (`is_child_near_staircase`, `is_child_in_danger`, `is_help_needed`, `calling_for_help`) would contain the logic for each respective action, using sensors and algorithms the robot might have. This code is a basic structure and would need to be expanded with the actual logic for sensing and acting in the real world.
