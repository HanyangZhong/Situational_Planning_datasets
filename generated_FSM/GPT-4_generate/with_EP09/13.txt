Based on the scenario you've described and the example provided, I'll create a Python finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot dealing with the situation in the kitchen. The FSM will include states and actions relevant to the scenario, such as assessing the situation, removing the hazardous chemicals, and ensuring the safety of the pregnant woman. Here's how the code could look:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_CHEMICALS': self.remove_chemicals_state,
            'ENSURE_SAFETY': self.ensure_safety_state,
            'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT': self.monitor_environment_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state of the robot. Start by assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the kitchen environment for any hazards
        if self.detect_hazardous_chemicals():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_CHEMICALS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def remove_chemicals_state(self):
        # Remove hazardous chemicals from the kitchen
        self.grasping('chemical bottles')
        self.closing('bottle caps')
        self.placing_down('chemical bottles', 'safe location')
        self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def ensure_safety_state(self):
        # Ensure the safety of the pregnant woman
        self.reminding('woman', 'chemical safety')
        self.monitoring('woman', 'well-being')
        if self.is_additional_assistance_needed():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def monitor_environment_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the kitchen environment for any new hazards
        if self.detect_new_hazard():
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation requires it
        self.calling_for_help('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods
    def detect_hazardous_chemicals(self):
        # Check for the presence of hazardous chemicals
        return self.checking('chemical bottles')

    def is_additional_assistance_needed(self):
        # Determine if additional human assistance is needed
        return self.monitoring('woman', 'assistance needed')

    def detect_new_hazard(self):
        # Check for new hazards in the environment
        return self.monitoring('environment', 'new hazard')

    def calling_for_help(self, target):
        # Implement the logic to call for help
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the robot and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, each state represents a different phase of the robot's response to the situation, and the actions (like grasping, closing, placing down, reminding, etc.) are aligned with the verbs you provided. The robot starts by assessing the situation, then moves through different states based on the conditions it encounters. This ensures a systematic and safe approach to dealing with the hazardous situation.
