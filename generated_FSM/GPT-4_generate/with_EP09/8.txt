Based on your scenario and requirements, I'll create a Python finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot that handles the situation with the open drawer of knives. The FSM will consist of states that correspond to the actions the robot should take, following the safety protocols and using the verbs you provided.

Here's an example of how such a Python FSM could be structured:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_KNIVES': self.secure_knives_state,
            'CHECK_ENVIRONMENT': self.check_environment_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state to start the assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation of the knife drawer
        if self.is_drawer_open():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_KNIVES'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CHECK_ENVIRONMENT'

    def secure_knives_state(self):
        # Secure the knives in the drawer
        self.closing('drawer')
        self.arranging('knives', 'safely in drawer')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_ENVIRONMENT'

    def check_environment_state(self):
        # Check if there's any further hazard in the environment
        if self.is_any_hazard_present():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if there's a hazard that the robot can't handle
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and checks
    def is_drawer_open(self):
        # Check if the drawer is open
        return self.checking('drawer', 'open status')

    def is_any_hazard_present(self):
        # Check for any other hazards in the environment
        return self.monitoring('environment', 'hazards')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Method to call for help
        self.calling('human assistance')

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, the robot begins in an initial state, assesses the situation, secures the knives if necessary, checks the environment for other hazards, and calls for human assistance if it encounters a situation it can't handle. Each state transition is based on the conditions and actions defined in the corresponding methods. The verbs from your list are used as method names for clarity, assuming these methods are implemented elsewhere in the robot's programming.
