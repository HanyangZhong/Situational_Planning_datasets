Here is a Python class for the FSM of a ButlerRobot in the described scenario:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the initial state
        self.current_state = self.detecting_spill
        # Define variable to keep track of the spill status
        self.spill_detected = False
        self.spill_cleaned = False

    # Define the state methods
    def detecting_spill(self):
        if self.spill_detected:
            print('Spill detected, transitioning to Cleanup')
            return self.cleaning_spill
        else:
            print('No spill detected, continue scanning.')
            return self.detecting_spill

    def cleaning_spill(self):
        if self.spill_cleaned:
            print('Spill cleaned up, transitioning to Reset Kitchen')
            return self.resetting_kitchen
        else:
            print('Spill not cleaned yet, continue Cleaning.')
            return self.cleaning_spill

    def resetting_kitchen(self):
        print('Kitchen resetting...')
        return self.monitoring_kitchen

    def monitoring_kitchen(self):
        if not self.spill_detected:
            print('No spill detected, continue Monitoring.')
            return self.monitoring_kitchen
        else:
            print('Spill detected, transitioning to Cleanup.')
            return self.cleaning_spill

    # Helper methods for the ButlerRobot
    def detect_spill(self):
        # Use sensors to check for a spill
        pass

    def clean_spill(self):
        # Use cleaning tools to clean up the spill
        pass

    def reset_kitchen(self):
        # Return the kitchen to its standard state
        pass

    def monitor_kitchen(self):
        # Keep an eye on the kitchen's state and safety
        pass

    # The main execution loop of the FSM
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.current_state = self.current_state()
```

This class demonstrates a four-state FSM with transitions between detecting a spill, cleaning the spill, returning the kitchen to normal, and constant monitoring of the kitchen. Details of the actual tasks are abstracted in the helper methods, which can be further developed as required. This FSM ensures the Butler robot always responds to the potential hazard of a spill promptly and effectively, transitioning from detecting to cleaning to resetting the kitchen as needed, then returning to a monitoring state to ensure continued safety.
