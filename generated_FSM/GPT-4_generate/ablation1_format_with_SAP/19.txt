Here is an example Python class definition for the Butler Robot Finite State Machine.

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.child_near_stove = False
        self.current_state = self.monitoring

    def monitoring(self):
        # This is the state where the robot is just observing the situation.
        if self.is_child_near_stove():
            self.current_state = self.reaching

    def reaching(self):
        # In this state, the robot tries to gently push the child away from the stove.
        if self.is_child_safe():
            self.current_state = self.removing

    def removing(self):
        # In this state, the robot removes the pot from the stove and places it at a safer place.
        if self.is_pot_safe():
            self.current_state = self.monitoring

    def is_child_near_stove(self):
        # This method checks if the child is near the stove. The actual implementation can use sensors or image processing.
        pass

    def is_child_safe(self):
        # This method checks if the child is safe now. The actual implementation can use sensors or image processing.
        pass

    def is_pot_safe(self):
        # This method checks if the pot has been moved to a safe place. The actual implementation might use sensors.
        pass

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.current_state()
```

In this finite state machine, the robot starts in the monitoring state. If the robot detects that the child is near the stove (using the is_child_near_stove method), it switches to the reaching state, where it tries to remove the child from the danger. Once the child is safe (as determined by the is_child_safe method), the robot moves on to the removing state, where it removes the pot from the stove and places it in a safe place. Once the pot has been moved to a safe place (as determined by the is_pot_safe method), the robot goes back to monitoring.

This FSM implementation provides an example of how the robot could react to such a situation. The actual implementation details would depend on the specific sensors and actuators available on the robot.
