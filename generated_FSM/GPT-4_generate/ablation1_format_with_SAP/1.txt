Here is a Python class definition for a ButlerRobotFSM based on the described scenario:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize state attribute
        self.current_state = self.check_the_scene

    # helper methods
    def is_floor_slippery(self):
        # Check whether the floor is slippery due to water splashes
        pass

    def is_towel_hanged(self):
        # Check whether the towel is hanged properly
        pass

    def is_bath_mat_positioned(self):
        # Check whether the bath mat is in its place
        pass

    # State methods
    def check_the_scene(self):
        if self.is_floor_slippery():
            self.current_state = self.clean_floor
            
        elif not self.is_towel_hanged():
            self.current_state = self.hang_towel

        elif not self.is_bath_mat_positioned():
            self.current_state = self.position_mat

    def clean_floor(self):
        # Steps: Reaching, Gripping mop, Mopping
        if not self.is_floor_slippery():
            self.current_state = self.check_the_scene

    def hang_towel(self):
        # Steps: Reaching, Gripping towel, Lifting towel, Hanging towel
        if self.is_towel_hanged():
            self.current_state = self.check_the_scene

    def position_mat(self):
        # Steps: Reaching, Gripping bath mat, Placing down bath mat
        if self.is_bath_mat_positioned():
            self.current_state = self.check_the_scene

    # Run method
    def run(self, steps=100):
        for _ in range(steps):
            self.current_state = self.current_state()

        # The robot does not perform actions if the scene is clean. So, if all checks in the check_the_scene method fail, it does nothing.
        # If number of steps exceed, it means the robot cannot achieve a clean scene for some reason, possibly due to problems in helper methods.
```

In this design, the butler robot first checks the scene. If the floor is slippery, it mops it first since it's most dangerous. Then, it checks if the towel is hanged properly and if it's not, it hangs the towel. After that, it checks if the bath mat is in its position and if it's not, it places the bath mat correctly. If all of these checks pass, it means no action is needed, and the robot stands by. The robot goes through these check in a loop by the run method until no action is needed or a predefined maximum step (100 by default) has been taken.
