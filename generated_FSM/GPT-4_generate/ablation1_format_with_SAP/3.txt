Below is a Python implementation of a finite state machine for the ButlerRobotFSM considering the scenario provided:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initializing robot's initial state 
        self.current_state = self.monitor_room
        self.candle_safe = True

    # State 1: Constantly monitor room
    def monitor_room(self):
        # For now, this method is abstract and does not have any actual implementation
        self.detect_danger()  # Detects dangerous situations

        if not self.candle_safe:
            self.current_state = self.reach_candle
            return
        # else continue monitoring
    
    # Action: Reaching out to the candle
    def reach_candle(self):
        # For now, this method is abstract and does not have any actual implementation

        self.current_state = self.lift_candle

    # Action: Lifting the candle
    def lift_candle(self):
        # For now, this method is abstract and does not have any actual implementation

        self.current_state = self.transport_candle

    # Action: Transporting the candle
    def transport_candle(self):
        # Here we are assuming that robot has a dedicated safe zone to place risky objects
        # For now, this method is abstract and does not have any actual implementation

        # We assume that the robot has successfully transported the candle to safe zone
        self.candle_safe = True
        self.current_state = self.monitor_room

    # Helper method: Detect dangerous scenarios
    def detect_danger(self):
        # This function would use some sensors or other means to detect danger
        # For now, we are hard coding that there is a risky candle situation

        self.candle_safe = False  # True if candle is safe, False otherwise

    # Run method: To run the FSM
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.current_state()
```

The robot begins in the "monitor_room" state, where it checks for any potentially dangerous scenarios, like a candle being too close to the books. If a dangerous situation is detected, it navigates the states to reach the candle, lift it, and then safely transport it to a safe zone. 
After that, the robot returns to its initial position to continue monitoring the room. The "run" method calls the current state method in an infinite loop, allowing the robot to react to changes as they occur. 

Note: Currently, all actions are assumed to be successful (eg. reaching the candle, lifting it, etc.). In a real-world scenario, error-checking would be indispensable.
