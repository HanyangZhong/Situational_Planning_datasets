Here is a simple representation of the state machine in Python. The robot is named ButlerRobotFSM which intuitively "sees" the situation and takes the required steps to assist the wheelchair user.

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.states = {
            'idle': self.idle,
            'evaluate_room': self.evaluate_room,
            'clear_path': self.clear_path,
            'assist': self.assist,
        }
        self.current_state = 'idle'

    def transition(self, new_state):
        # Switch to new state
        self.current_state = new_state

    def idle(self):
        # Initially robot is in idle state
        # lets consider robot is turned on by user
        print("Turning on......")
        self.transition('evaluate_room')

    def evaluate_room(self):
        # Robot asseses the situation
        print("Evaluating the room......")
        office_chair = self.check_obstruction()
        
        if office_chair:
            self.transition('clear_path')
        else:
            self.transition('assist')

    # Helper method to check whether there is an obstruction or not
    def check_obstruction(self):
        # this method will return True if there is an obstruction (office chair)
        # False otherwise
        return True

    def clear_path(self):
        # In this state, Robot will remove the office chair
        print("Reaching, Gripping, Lifting......")
        print("Transporting and Lowering.......")
        print("Rotating and Releasing.......")
        print("Path to desk is clear now")
        self.transition('assist')

    def assist(self):
        # robot can now assist the person in the wheelchair
        print("Assisting the person to the desk.......")
        
        # Later, based on requirement, robot can transition to different tasks/states
        # like 'monitoring', 'calling for help', 'arranging books', etc.,

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create a robot and Run the FSM
butler = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler.run()
```

The robot starts in the 'idle' state, and transitions between 'evaluate_room', 'clear_path', and 'assist' states based on the situation in the study room. 

This simple FSM could be extended with additional states or actions to represent more complex behaviours, for example states to handle additional obstacles, or to assist the person in other ways. 

This code does not include any error handling or other robustness features that would be needed for a real robot.
