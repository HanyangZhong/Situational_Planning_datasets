Here is a Python class for a finite state machine (FSM) to represent the scenario you provided:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.states = ["idle", 
                        "extinguishing_flame", 
                        "cooling_pan", 
                        "cleaning_area", 
                        "checking_airflow", 
                        "enhancing_lighting", 
                        "monitoring_state"]
        self.current_state = "idle"
        self.kitchen_items = []

    # Helper Methods
    def check_flame(self):
        # check the condition of the stove flame, return True if the flame is on
        pass

    def check_pan_heat(self):
        # Check the temperature of the saucepan to ensure it's not overheating
        pass

    def check_airflow(self):
        # Check the extractor fan and the status of the windows to determine their conditions
        pass

    def check_lighting(self):
        # Check the current lighting status of the kitchen
        pass

    # State Methods
    def extinguishing_flame(self):
        # Task: turning off the stove and extinguishing the flame
        pass

    def cooling_pan(self):
        # Task: Removing the pan from the stove and placing it in a safe location to cool
        pass

    def cleaning_area(self):
        # Tasks: Collecting and placing down kitchen items away from stove
        pass

    def checking_airflow(self):
        # Tasks: Turning on the extractor fan and opening windows to improve ventilation
        pass

    def enhancing_lighting(self):
        # Task: turning on lights to improve visibility in the kitchen
        pass

    def monitoring_state(self):
        # keep monitoring the kitchen's current state to ensure safety
        pass

    # Transition Logic
    def transition(self):
        if self.current_state == "idle":
            if self.check_flame():
                self.current_state = "extinguishing_flame"
                
        elif self.current_state == "extinguishing_flame":
            if not self.check_flame() and self.check_pan_heat():
                self.current_state = "cooling_pan"
                
        elif self.current_state == "cooling_pan":
            if not self.check_pan_heat():
                self.current_state = "cleaning_area"
                
        elif self.current_state == "cleaning_area":
            if self.check_airflow():
                self.current_state = "checking_airflow"
                
        elif self.current_state == "checking_airflow":
            if not self.check_airflow() and self.check_lighting():
                self.current_state = "enhancing_lighting"
                
        elif self.current_state == "enhancing_lighting":
            if not self.check_lighting():
                self.current_state = "monitoring_state"
                
        elif self.current_state == "monitoring_state":
            if not self.check_flame() and not self.check_pan_heat() and not self.check_airflow() and not self.check_lighting():
                self.current_state = "idle"

    # Run Method
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.transition()
            getattr(self, self.current_state)()
```

This FSM engages the robot to turn off the stove, cool down the pan, move flammables away, ensure proper airflow and good lighting, then monitor the kitchen environment to ensure the safety thereof. The robot will transition from one state to another based on the evaluations of the helper methods. This process will repeat as the robot continuously monitors the kitchen environment. 

Remember, this is a high-level architecture. Actual programming of robot actions, object recognition, and sensor data integrations are complex tasks that require advanced artificial intelligence and robotics knowledge.
