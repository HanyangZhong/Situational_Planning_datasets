This FSM represents the high-level actions a Butler Robot would take to ensure child safety in the scenario of a child close to an unprotected staircase. It defines the actions: monitoring, securing the child, and installing a safety gate using an iterative approach. This FSM should be further tailored to the specific inputs and structure of the robot's operational environment.
