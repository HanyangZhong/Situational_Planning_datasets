Sure, here's a simple Finite State Machine implemented in Python for a hypothetical ButlerRobotFSM dealing with the scenario you have mentioned.

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_state = self.monitoring_toys
        self.small_toys = []
 
    # Monitor state checks if there are any small toys within reach of the child
    def monitoring_toys(self): 
        if len(self.small_toys) > 0: 
            return self.collecting_toys
        return self.monitoring_toys
 
    # Collect state retrieves dangerous toys from the child's vicinity
    def collecting_toys(self):
        if len(self.small_toys) > 0:    
            self.remove_toy()
            return self.collecting_toys
        return self.monitoring_toys

    # Monitor state checks if there are any small toys near the child
    def remove_toy(self):       
        toy = self.small_toys.pop()
        # [Reaching, Gripping, Lifting, Transporting, Releasing] the toy
        print("Toy removed: ", toy)

    # Method to simulate recognizing and adding any dangerous toys near the child
    def find_small_toys(self, toys):
        self.small_toys.extend(toys)
        print("Small toys detected: ", toys)

    # State machine loop
    def run(self):              
        while True:
            self.current_state = self.current_state()

```

In this scenario, the ButlerRobotFSM continuously monitors the playroom and collects any small toys that might pose a choking hazard to the child. It switches between two states: monitoring_toys and collecting_toys. 

When the `find_small_toys()` method identifies small toys, it adds them to the list of small_toys. If there are items in the small_toys list, the FSM enters the collecting_toys state and proceeds to remove these toys (i.e., reaching, gripping, lifting, transporting, releasing) one by one from the child's vicinity. 

Once all hazardous toys have been removed, it returns to the monitoring_toys state to continue observing the playroom. 

You can simulate recognizing small toys by calling find_small_toys with a list of toys like so:

```python
brfsm = ButlerRobotFSM()
brfsm.find_small_toys(['toy1', 'toy2', 'toy3'])  # Simulates recognizing small toys
brfsm.run()  # Starts the FSM loop
```
