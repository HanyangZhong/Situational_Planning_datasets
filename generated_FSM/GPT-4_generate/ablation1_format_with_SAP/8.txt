Here is an example of a ButlerRobotFSM class. 

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initial state
        self.current_state = self.check_environment

        # Safety level for drawer
        self.drawer_safety = False

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.current_state()

    # State Methods:

    def check_environment(self):
        # Check the surrounding environment for any potential danger
        if self.check_knife_drawer():
            self.current_state = self.make_drawer_safe
        else:
            self.current_state = self.assist_cooking

    def make_drawer_safe(self):
        # Make the drawer safe
        self.close_drawer()
        self.organize_knives()
        self.install_safety_lock()
        self.drawer_safety = True
        print('Drawer is now safe.')
        self.current_state = self.check_environment

    def assist_cooking(self):
        # Assist in meal preparation
        if not self.drawer_safety:
            self.current_state = self.check_environment
        else:
            print('Assisting in cooking...')

    # Helper Methods:

    def check_knife_drawer(self):
        # Check the safety of the knife drawer
        # This function would contain the logic to analyze the scene
        print('Checking knife drawer...')
        return True  # For this example, we'll assume drawer is always unsafe initially

    def close_drawer(self):
        # Close the knife drawer
        print('Closing the drawer...')

    def organize_knives(self):
        # Organize the knives
        print('Organizing the knives...')

    def install_safety_lock(self):
        # Install a safety lock
        print('Installing safety lock...')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
    robot.run()
```

In this example, the butler robot initially checks the environment in particular for hazard points such as the knife drawer in the kitchen, if it's not safely arranged it takes action to make it safe by closing the drawer, organizing the knives, and installing a safety lock. 

After ensuring the safety in the kitchen, the robot then turns its focus onto assisting in the cooking process. This loop goes on infinitely in the run method until the program is terminated. We have assumed for simplicity that once the drawer is made safe, it remains safe, which in a real-world scenario, would not be the case, hence a continuous monitoring system would be needed.

Following the list of verbs/actions, in each of the helper methods, the robot is supposed to perform the actual action specified by the print statements.
