To create a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot dealing with the described scenario in a bathroom, we need to define states that represent the different stages of the robot's actions, based on the given situation and the list of verbs provided. Here's an example of how this FSM might be structured:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_MEDICATION': self.secure_medication_state,
            'CLEAN_UP_SPILLS': self.clean_up_spills_state,
            'RESTORE_ORDER': self.restore_order_state,
            'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT': self.monitor_environment_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: Start by assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the bathroom for potential hazards
        if self.is_medication_unsecured():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_MEDICATION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def secure_medication_state(self):
        # Secure any open medication containers
        self.collecting('medications')
        self.placing_down('medications', 'secure location')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_UP_SPILLS'

    def clean_up_spills_state(self):
        # Clean up any spilled pills
        self.sweeping('spilled pills')
        self.collecting('spilled pills')
        self.current_state = 'RESTORE_ORDER'

    def restore_order_state(self):
        # Restore order to the bathroom
        self.arranging('medication bottles')
        self.closing('medicine cabinet')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'

    def monitor_environment_state(self):
        # Monitor the environment for any further risks
        if self.is_risk_detected():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if a risk is detected
        self.calling_for_help('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for conditions and actions
    def is_medication_unsecured(self):
        # Check if medication is unsecured
        return True  # Simplified for example

    def is_risk_detected(self):
        # Check for any further risks
        return False  # Simplified for example

    def calling_for_help(self, assistance_type):
        # Placeholder for calling for help
        pass

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code provides a basic structure for the FSM. Each state corresponds to a specific action or set of actions that the robot should perform in response to the bathroom scene. Note that the helper methods (`is_medication_unsecured`, `is_risk_detected`, `calling_for_help`) are placeholders and should be implemented based on the robot's sensors and capabilities. The loop in the `run` method continuously executes the FSM, transitioning between states as conditions change.
