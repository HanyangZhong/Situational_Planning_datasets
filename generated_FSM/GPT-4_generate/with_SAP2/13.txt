To create a finite state machine for a butler robot in a scenario where a pregnant woman is exposed to open cleaning chemicals in a kitchen, we'll follow a similar structure to the example you provided. The FSM will handle the situation by assessing the environment, taking appropriate actions to mitigate the hazard, and ensuring the safety of the woman. 

Here's a Python code that represents this logic:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_CHEMICALS': self.remove_chemicals_state,
            'ENSURE_SAFETY': self.ensure_safety_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Initialize the current state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state, start with assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if there are open chemicals near the pregnant woman.
        if self.are_chemicals_open():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_CHEMICALS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def remove_chemicals_state(self):
        # If open chemicals are present, safely remove them.
        self.grasping('chemical bottles')
        self.closing('chemical bottles')
        self.placing_down('chemical bottles', 'safe place')
        self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def ensure_safety_state(self):
        # Ensure the woman's safety in the kitchen.
        self.monitoring('woman', 'kitchen environment')
        self.reminding('woman', 'chemical safety')
        if self.is_additional_help_needed():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation is beyond the robot's capability.
        self.calling_for_help('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and conditions
    def are_chemicals_open(self):
        # Check if the chemical bottles are open
        return self.checking('chemical bottles', 'open status')

    def is_additional_help_needed(self):
        # Determine if extra help is needed
        return self.checking('woman', 'additional assistance needed')

    def calling_for_help(self, assistance_type):
        # Method to call for help
        self.calling(assistance_type)

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Instantiate and run the Butler Robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code defines a finite state machine for a butler robot that addresses the specific scenario of a pregnant woman exposed to hazardous chemicals in a kitchen. The FSM transitions through various states based on the assessment of the situation and takes appropriate actions to ensure the woman's safety. The robot assesses the environment, removes the chemicals if they are open, ensures the ongoing safety of the woman, and calls for human help if necessary.
