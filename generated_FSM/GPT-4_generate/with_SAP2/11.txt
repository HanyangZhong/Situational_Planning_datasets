Based on your description, I'll create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in a scenario where a person is suffering from a headache and is unable to reach their medicine. The FSM will include states and actions relevant to this scenario, using the verbs you've provided. The robot's primary goal is to assist the person by providing the medicine and ensuring their comfort.

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'RETRIEVE_MEDICINE': self.retrieve_medicine_state,
            'ASSIST_PERSON': self.assist_person_state,
            'MONITOR_CONDITION': self.monitor_condition_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state of the robot, start with assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if the person needs assistance with medicine.
        if self.can_see_person_struggling():
            self.current_state = 'RETRIEVE_MEDICINE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_CONDITION'

    def retrieve_medicine_state(self):
        # Retrieve the medicine from the table.
        self.grasping('medicine bottle')
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_PERSON'

    def assist_person_state(self):
        # Assist the person with the medicine.
        self.delivering('medicine', 'person')
        self.monitoring('person’s reaction')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_CONDITION'

    def monitor_condition_state(self):
        # Monitor the person's condition after medicine is administered.
        if self.is_person_still_unwell():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the person’s condition does not improve.
        self.calling('emergency services')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions and checks
    def can_see_person_struggling(self):
        # Check if the person is struggling to reach medicine.
        return self.checking('person', 'struggle')

    def is_person_still_unwell(self):
        # Check if the person is still unwell after taking medicine.
        return self.monitoring('person', 'health condition')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, the robot starts by assessing the situation, then moves through states to retrieve and deliver medicine, monitor the person's condition, and call for help if necessary. Helper methods like `can_see_person_struggling` and `is_person_still_unwell` represent the robot's sensors and decision-making capabilities. This code structure enables the robot to react dynamically to the person's needs in the given scenario.
