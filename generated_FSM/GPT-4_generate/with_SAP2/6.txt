Based on your description of the laundry room scene and the requirements for the finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot, we can design a Python class that reflects this scenario. The FSM will include states to address the hazardous situation in the laundry room, taking into account the safety of humans and animals, and the proper handling of cleaning products.

Here's an FSM implementation for the butler robot in this specific scenario:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_CHEMICALS': self.secure_chemicals_state,
            'CLEAN_SPILL': self.clean_spill_state,
            'CHECK_FOR_DANGERS': self.check_for_dangers_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Butler Robot initial state. Start with an assessment of the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the laundry room for potential hazards.
        if self.is_chemical_spill_detected():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_CHEMICALS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CHECK_FOR_DANGERS'

    def secure_chemicals_state(self):
        # Secure all open chemicals and place them safely on the shelves.
        self.closing('chemical containers')
        self.placing_down('chemicals', 'safe location')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_SPILL'

    def clean_spill_state(self):
        # Clean any chemical spills safely.
        self.wiping('spilled chemicals')
        self.sweeping('area for glass or other hazards')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_FOR_DANGERS'

    def check_for_dangers_state(self):
        # Check for any other dangers in the room, such as open doors or windows.
        if self.is_door_open():
            self.closing('door')
        # If situation is beyond control, call for help
        if self.is_situation_hazardous():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance in case of an unmanageable situation.
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods to simulate sensor inputs and actions
    def is_chemical_spill_detected(self):
        # Simulate checking for chemical spill
        return True  # Placeholder for actual sensor input

    def is_door_open(self):
        # Simulate checking if the door is open
        return True  # Placeholder for actual sensor input

    def is_situation_hazardous(self):
        # Simulate assessing if the situation is hazardous
        return False  # Placeholder for actual sensor input

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Simulate calling for help
        print("Calling for human assistance")

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This FSM includes states for assessing the situation, securing chemicals, cleaning spills, checking for additional dangers, and calling for help if necessary. The actions (e.g., 'closing', 'placing down', 'wiping') are placeholders for the actual robot operations and would need to be implemented with the robot's specific capabilities. The `while True` loop in the `run` method simulates continuous operation of the robot.
