To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described living room scene, we need to carefully consider the actions and states that are relevant to the situation. The FSM will have states that correspond to different stages of the robot's response to the situation, with transitions based on the assessment of the environment and the actions taken.

Here's a Python implementation of such an FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define states
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'CALM_DOG': self.calm_dog_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: begin with situation assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the interaction between the child and the dog
        if self.is_play_too_rough():
            self.current_state = 'CALM_DOG'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def calm_dog_state(self):
        # Calm the dog to ensure safety
        self.calming('dog')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage with the child to distract from rough play
        self.distracting('child')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation
        if self.is_danger_detected():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        elif self.is_intervention_needed():
            self.current_state = 'CALM_DOG'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation escalates
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods
    def is_play_too_rough(self):
        # Check if the play is too rough
        return self.monitoring('child', 'dog')

    def calming(self, entity):
        # Calm the dog
        self.speaking_to(entity, 'calm down')

    def distracting(self, entity):
        # Engage the child with safe activities
        self.presenting(entity, 'safe toys')

    def is_danger_detected(self):
        # Check for any immediate danger
        return self.monitoring('child', 'dog', 'danger')

    def is_intervention_needed(self):
        # Determine if further intervention is needed
        return self.monitoring('child', 'dog', 'intervention needed')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.calling('human assistance')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Instantiate and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM, the robot starts by assessing the situation, then takes appropriate actions based on its observations. It may calm the dog, engage the child, monitor the situation continuously, and call for help if necessary. The transitions between states depend on the conditions evaluated in each state, such as whether the play is too rough or if there's any immediate danger detected.
