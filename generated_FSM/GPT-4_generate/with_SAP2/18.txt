To design a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described living room scene, we need to define states and transitions based on the situation and the actions the robot can take. The robot's primary goal is to ensure the child's safety concerning the electrical outlet. Here's a Python implementation of such an FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define states
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'REMOVE_DANGER': self.remove_danger_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: start with assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the child's proximity to the electrical outlet
        if self.is_child_near_outlet():
            self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage with the child to distract them from the outlet
        self.engaging_child_away_from_danger()
        self.current_state = 'REMOVE_DANGER'

    def remove_danger_state(self):
        # Remove the danger by covering the outlet or moving the child
        if not self.is_outlet_covered():
            self.covering_outlet()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation
        if self.is_child_safe():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # If the situation escalates, call for human assistance
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Helper methods
    def is_child_near_outlet(self):
        # Check if the child is near the electrical outlet
        return self.monitoring('child', 'electrical outlet')

    def engaging_child_away_from_danger(self):
        # Engage the child with safe activities
        self.distracting_child_from_danger()

    def is_outlet_covered(self):
        # Check if the outlet is covered
        return self.checking('outlet cover')

    def covering_outlet(self):
        # Cover the electrical outlet
        self.affixing('outlet cover')

    def is_child_safe(self):
        # Assess if the child is now safe
        return self.monitoring('child', 'safety')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.calling_for_help()

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code outlines the basic structure and logic of the FSM for the butler robot. Each state represents a different scenario in the living room, and transitions between states are based on the assessment of the child's safety and actions taken by the robot. The actions (like `monitoring`, `distracting_child_from_danger`, `checking`, `affixing`, `calling_for_help`) are placeholders for the actual implementations that would depend on the robot's capabilities.
