To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot that responds to the described kitchen scene, we need to define states that guide the robot's actions in assisting the pregnant woman who has fallen and is unable to reach the emergency alert system. The FSM will focus on assessing the situation, providing immediate assistance, and ensuring long-term safety.

Here is a Python implementation of such an FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'ASSIST_WOMAN': self.assist_woman_state,
            'ACTIVATE_ALERT': self.activate_alert_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state. Begin with situation assessment.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation: Check if the woman needs immediate help
        if self.detects_fallen_woman():
            self.current_state = 'ASSIST_WOMAN'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def assist_woman_state(self):
        # Assist the woman: Help her to a safe position
        self.reaching('woman')
        self.lifting('woman', 'to a safe position')
        self.current_state = 'ACTIVATE_ALERT'

    def activate_alert_state(self):
        # Activate the emergency alert
        self.reaching('alert button')
        self.pressing('alert button')
        self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation for any changes
        if self.detects_emergency():
            self.current_state = 'ACTIVATE_ALERT'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.calling('emergency services')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def detects_fallen_woman(self):
        # Detect if a person has fallen and needs help
        return self.monitoring('fallen woman')

    def detects_emergency(self):
        # Detect if there is an emergency situation
        return self.monitoring('emergency situation')

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code represents a simple FSM for a butler robot. It includes states for assessing the situation, assisting the fallen woman, activating an emergency alert, monitoring the situation, and calling for help. The methods like `detects_fallen_woman` or `monitoring` are placeholders for actual sensor or AI logic that would be part of a real robot's implementation. The FSM continuously cycles through these states, reacting to the changes in the environment.
