Based on the scenario you've described, I will create a finite state machine (FSM) in Python for a butler robot that operates in a playroom with a young child. The FSM will focus on ensuring the child's safety, particularly regarding the risk of choking on small toys. I'll use your provided verbs and integrate them into the FSM logic, considering the interactions with the child, the environment, and the potential hazards.

```python
class ButlerRobotPlayroomFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_HAZARDS': self.remove_hazards_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state: start by assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Check for any choking hazards
        if self.detected_choking_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def remove_hazards_state(self):
        # Remove small toys that could pose a choking hazard
        self.collecting('small toys')
        self.placing_down('small toys', 'safe storage')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage with the child to ensure they are occupied safely
        self.delivering('safe toys', 'to child')
        self.reminding('child', 'safe play')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child's play
        if self.detected_new_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'
        elif self.is_child_unsafe():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if there's an urgent safety concern
        self.calling_for_help('urgent safety concern')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods to simulate actions and checks
    def detected_choking_hazards(self):
        # Simulate detection of choking hazards
        return True  # Placeholder logic

    def detected_new_hazards(self):
        # Simulate detection of new hazards during play
        return False  # Placeholder logic

    def is_child_unsafe(self):
        # Check if the child is in an unsafe situation
        return False  # Placeholder logic

    def calling_for_help(self, reason):
        # Simulate calling for help
        print(f"Calling for help due to {reason}")

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            state_function = self.states[self.current_state]
            state_function()

# Create and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotPlayroomFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This FSM includes states for assessing the situation, removing hazards, engaging the child with safe activities, monitoring ongoing play, and calling for help if necessary. The helper methods are placeholders and would be implemented with actual logic for detecting hazards and determining safety in a real-world application.
