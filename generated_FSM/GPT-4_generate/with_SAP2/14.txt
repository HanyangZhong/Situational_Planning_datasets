To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in a kitchen scenario with a pet hazard, we'll follow the structure you've provided and adapt it to fit the specific scene. The states in this FSM will reflect the robot's decision-making process as it identifies and mitigates the risk to the cat. The actions will be chosen from the list you provided, tailored to the needs of this situation.

Here's a Python implementation of the FSM:

```python
class KitchenSafetyRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_TOXIC_FOOD': self.remove_toxic_food_state,
            'SECURE_CAT': self.secure_cat_state,
            'MONITOR_KITCHEN': self.monitor_kitchen_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state, robot starts by assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the kitchen for potential hazards to the cat
        if self.is_toxic_food_accessible() and self.is_cat_near_counter():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_TOXIC_FOOD'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_KITCHEN'

    def remove_toxic_food_state(self):
        # Remove toxic food from the cat's reach
        self.grasping('toxic food')
        self.placing_down('toxic food', 'safe location')
        self.current_state = 'SECURE_CAT'

    def secure_cat_state(self):
        # Ensure the cat is safe and away from hazards
        self.monitoring('cat')
        if self.is_cat_safe():
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_KITCHEN'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def monitor_kitchen_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the kitchen for safety
        if self.detect_new_hazard():
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation is beyond the robot's capability
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods
    def is_toxic_food_accessible(self):
        # Check if toxic food is within reach of the cat
        return self.checking('toxic food accessibility')

    def is_cat_near_counter(self):
        # Check if the cat is near the counter
        return self.monitoring('cat', 'counter')

    def is_cat_safe(self):
        # Check if the cat is in a safe location
        return self.monitoring('cat', 'safety')

    def detect_new_hazard(self):
        # Detect any new hazards in the kitchen
        return self.monitoring('kitchen', 'new hazard')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.calling('human assistance')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the FSM and run it
kitchen_safety_robot = KitchenSafetyRobotFSM()
kitchen_safety_robot.run()
```

This code defines an FSM for a butler robot in a kitchen scenario where it needs to ensure the safety of a cat from toxic foods. The robot assesses the situation, removes hazardous items, secures the cat, and continuously monitors the kitchen. If necessary, it calls for human assistance. The actions are aligned with your provided list and the FSM logic is structured to handle this specific scenario.
