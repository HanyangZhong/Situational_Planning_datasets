To create a finite state machine (FSM) in Python for a butler robot handling the described kitchen scene, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Define the states:** Each state represents a phase of the robot's task handling the kitchen hazard. 

2. **Define transitions:** Determine how the robot moves from one state to another based on the assessment of the situation and completion of tasks.

3. **Define actions:** Assign specific actions (from the provided verbs list) to each state.

4. **Run the FSM:** Continuously loop through the states, performing actions and transitioning based on the situation.

Here is the Python code for this scenario:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states
        self.states = {
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'HANDLE_SPILL': self.handle_spill_state,
            'SECURE_PETS': self.secure_pets_state,
            'CLEAN_UP': self.clean_up_state,
            'FINAL_CHECK': self.final_check_state,
            'IDLE': self.idle_state
        }
        # Initial state
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the kitchen for hazards and determine next action
        if self.detect_spill():
            self.current_state = 'HANDLE_SPILL'
        elif self.detect_pets_nearby():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_PETS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'IDLE'

    def handle_spill_state(self):
        # Handle the spill by securing the area and cleaning up
        self.securing('spill area')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_UP'

    def secure_pets_state(self):
        # Secure pets to prevent them from entering the hazardous area
        self.removing('pets', 'hazard area')
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def clean_up_state(self):
        # Clean up the spill
        self.mopping('spill area')
        self.current_state = 'FINAL_CHECK'

    def final_check_state(self):
        # Final check to ensure safety and cleanliness
        if self.is_area_clean_and_safe():
            self.current_state = 'IDLE'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def idle_state(self):
        # Idle state, waiting for further tasks or reassessment
        self.monitoring('kitchen environment')

    # Define action methods
    def detect_spill(self):
        # Check for spills in the kitchen
        return True  # Simplified for example

    def detect_pets_nearby(self):
        # Check for pets near the hazardous area
        return False  # Simplified for example

    def securing(self, area):
        # Secure the specified area
        pass  # Action implementation

    def removing(self, entity, area):
        # Remove specified entity from the area
        pass  # Action implementation

    def mopping(self, area):
        # Mop the specified area
        pass  # Action implementation

    def is_area_clean_and_safe(self):
        # Check if the area is clean and safe
        return True  # Simplified for example

    def monitoring(self, environment):
        # Monitor the specified environment
        pass  # Action implementation

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create and run the robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code provides a basic structure for the FSM, including states like assessing the situation, handling the spill, securing pets, cleaning up, and doing a final check. Each state includes actions that the robot should perform, and the transitions are based on the completion of these tasks and the ongoing assessment of the environment. Note that the actual implementation of actions like detecting spills, securing areas, and mopping is simplified and would require more detailed programming in a real-world application.
