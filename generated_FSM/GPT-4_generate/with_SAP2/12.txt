To design a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described scenario, we need to create states that reflect the robot's tasks in maintaining a safe environment for the pregnant woman. The FSM will follow a similar structure to your example, but with states and actions tailored to the scenario. 

The FSM should consider the following key tasks:
1. **Identifying hazards**: Detecting potential tripping hazards like curled rug edges, toys, magazines, etc.
2. **Mitigating hazards**: Safely removing or reorganizing these hazards.
3. **Ensuring ongoing safety**: Continuously monitoring the environment and responding to changes.

Here's a Python implementation of this concept:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'IDENTIFY_HAZARDS': self.identify_hazards_state,
            'MITIGATE_HAZARDS': self.mitigate_hazards_state,
            'ENSURE_SAFETY': self.ensure_safety_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        self.current_state = 'IDENTIFY_HAZARDS'

    def identify_hazards_state(self):
        if self.detect_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'MITIGATE_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def mitigate_hazards_state(self):
        self.reorganize_hazards()
        self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def ensure_safety_state(self):
        if self.detect_new_hazards():
            self.current_state = 'IDENTIFY_HAZARDS'
        elif self.detect_emergency():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        self.call_for_human_assistance()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Actions / Annotation methods
    def detect_hazards(self):
        # Check for tripping hazards
        return self.checking('tripping hazards')

    def reorganize_hazards(self):
        # Safely remove or reorganize hazards
        self.collecting('hazards')
        self.placing_down('hazards', 'safe location')

    def detect_new_hazards(self):
        # Continuously check for new hazards
        return self.monitoring('new hazards')

    def detect_emergency(self):
        # Check for any emergency situation
        return self.monitoring('emergency')

    def call_for_human_assistance(self):
        # Call for human assistance in case of emergency
        self.calling('human assistance')

    # Run the FSM loop    
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This FSM represents a butler robot that initially identifies hazards in the room, mitigates them by reorganizing or removing them, ensures ongoing safety by continuously monitoring the environment, and calls for human assistance if an emergency is detected. The `detect_hazards`, `reorganize_hazards`, `detect_new_hazards`, `detect_emergency`, and `call_for_human_assistance` methods would contain the logic for each respective action, using the verbs provided in your list.
