To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in a kitchen scene where a child is reaching for sharp objects, we'll define states and transitions relevant to this scenario. The FSM will focus on ensuring the child's safety by addressing the immediate danger and preventing future risks. We'll use Python code and adhere to the constraints and verbs provided.

Here's a Python example of such an FSM:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_DANGER': self.remove_danger_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Start with situation assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Check if the child is reaching for sharp objects
        if self.is_child_reaching_for_danger():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_DANGER'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def remove_danger_state(self):
        # Remove sharp objects from the child's reach
        self.grasping('sharp objects')
        self.placing_down('sharp objects', 'safe place')
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage with the child to divert attention
        self.delivering('safe toys', 'to child')
        self.reminding('child', 'kitchen safety')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation for safety
        if self.is_child_safe():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation escalates
        self.calling_for_help('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for state actions
    def is_child_reaching_for_danger(self):
        # Check if the child is reaching for dangerous objects
        return self.monitoring('child', 'sharp objects')

    def is_child_safe(self):
        # Check if the child is in a safe situation
        return self.monitoring('child', 'safe environment')

    def calling_for_help(self, assistance_type):
        # Placeholder for calling for help
        print(f"Calling for {assistance_type}")

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this FSM:
- The `INITIAL` state starts the cycle, leading to an assessment of the situation.
- `ASSESS_SITUATION` checks if the child is in danger.
- `REMOVE_DANGER` involves removing sharp objects from the child's reach.
- `ENGAGE_CHILD` focuses on distracting the child with safe activities and reminding them of safety.
- `MONITOR_SITUATION` continually assesses the child's safety.
- `CALL_FOR_HELP` is the state for when the situation requires human intervention.

This example assumes the implementation of methods like `monitoring`, `grasping`, `placing_down`, etc., which should be tailored to the robot's specific capabilities and sensors. The FSM loop continuously evaluates and transitions between states based on the situation.
