Creating a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot to address the specific situation you described involves carefully considering the environment and the actions the robot needs to take. Given the scene and the verbs provided, I'll design an FSM that helps the robot navigate the study, remove the obstruction (the office chair), and assist the wheelchair user.

Here's an FSM example in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_OBSTRUCTION': self.remove_obstruction_state,
            'ASSIST_USER': self.assist_user_state,
            'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT': self.monitor_environment_state,
            'FINISHED': self.finished_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # The robot's initial state. Start by assessing the situation.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation in the study room
        if self.is_path_blocked():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_OBSTRUCTION'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'ASSIST_USER'

    def remove_obstruction_state(self):
        # Remove the obstruction (the office chair) from the path
        self.grasping('office chair')
        self.dragging('office chair', 'to a suitable location')
        self.placing_down('office chair')
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_USER'

    def assist_user_state(self):
        # Assist the wheelchair user to reach the desk
        if self.is_user_ready():
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'
        else:
            self.reminding('user', 'ready to move')
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def monitor_environment_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the environment for any changes
        if self.is_intervention_needed():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'FINISHED'

    def finished_state(self):
        # The task is complete
        pass

    # Helper methods for the robot's actions
    def is_path_blocked(self):
        # Check if the path to the desk is blocked
        return True  # Assuming the path is always initially blocked

    def is_user_ready(self):
        # Check if the wheelchair user is ready to move
        return True  # Assuming the user is ready

    def is_intervention_needed(self):
        # Monitor if any further intervention is needed
        return False  # Assuming no further intervention is needed

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while self.current_state != 'FINISHED':
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the ButlerRobotFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code defines a basic FSM for a butler robot in a study room scenario. Each state represents a step in the robot's task, from assessing the situation to assisting the user and ensuring the environment remains safe. The helper methods (`is_path_blocked`, `is_user_ready`, `is_intervention_needed`) are placeholders and should be replaced with actual sensor and logic implementations.
