To create a finite state machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described kitchen scenario, we need to define various states that the robot can be in and actions it should take in each state. The robot's primary concern should be to mitigate the fire risk and ensure safety. Here's a Python implementation of such an FSM:

```python
class KitchenSafetyRobotFSM:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'CHECK_FLAME': self.check_flame_state,
            'REMOVE_HAZARDS': self.remove_hazards_state,
            'VENTILATE_AREA': self.ventilate_area_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial assessment of the situation.
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_FLAME'

    def check_flame_state(self):
        # Check if the flame is on and unattended.
        if self.checking('flame'):
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def remove_hazards_state(self):
        # Remove any flammable objects near the stove.
        self.grasping('dish towel')
        self.placing_down('dish towel', 'safe location')
        self.grasping('oil bottle')
        self.placing_down('oil bottle', 'safe location')
        self.grasping('wooden cutting board')
        self.placing_down('wooden cutting board', 'safe location')
        self.current_state = 'VENTILATE_AREA'

    def ventilate_area_state(self):
        # Ventilate the area to prevent gas build-up.
        self.opening('window')
        self.turning('extractor fan', 'on')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation for any changes.
        if self.is_danger_detected():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation worsens.
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action / Helper methods
    def checking(self, item):
        # Check the status of the item (e.g., flame, window).
        # Implementation depends on robot's sensors and capabilities.
        return True  # Example: Always returns True for simplicity

    def is_danger_detected(self):
        # Determine if there's any immediate danger.
        # Implementation depends on robot's sensors and capabilities.
        return False  # Example: Always returns False for simplicity

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Call for human assistance.
        # Implementation depends on robot's communication capabilities.
        pass  # Placeholder for actual implementation

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Instantiate and run the robot FSM
safety_robot = KitchenSafetyRobotFSM()
safety_robot.run()
```

In this code:
- Each state corresponds to a specific part of the robot's task in ensuring kitchen safety.
- The `initial_state` begins the process by moving to the `check_flame_state`.
- In `check_flame_state`, the robot checks if the flame is on and unattended.
- `remove_hazards_state` involves removing flammable objects from near the stove.
- `ventilate_area_state` ensures proper ventilation to avoid gas build-up.
- `monitor_situation_state` keeps the robot vigilant for any further risks.
- If any danger is detected, `call_for_help_state` is initiated to seek human assistance.
- Action/helper methods (`checking`, `is_danger_detected`, `calling_for_help`) are placeholders and would need real implementations based on the robot's capabilities.
