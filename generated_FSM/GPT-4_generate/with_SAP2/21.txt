Creating a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot in a scenario where a disabled person has fallen from their wheelchair in their bedroom involves several steps. The FSM will guide the robot through a sequence of states, each representing a specific task or assessment. The goal is to ensure the person's safety and comfort.

Here's an example of how such an FSM could be structured in Python:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REACH_EMERGENCY_BUTTON': self.reach_emergency_button_state,
            'ASSIST_PERSON': self.assist_person_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state,
            'ENSURE_COMFORT': self.ensure_comfort_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state
        }
        # Set initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state to start the assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the situation: Check if person is conscious and if immediate help is needed
        if self.check_person_condition():
            self.current_state = 'REACH_EMERGENCY_BUTTON'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def reach_emergency_button_state(self):
        # Reach and press the emergency button
        self.reaching('emergency button')
        self.pressing('emergency button')
        self.current_state = 'ASSIST_PERSON'

    def assist_person_state(self):
        # Assist the person to a safe and comfortable position
        self.grasping('person')
        self.lifting('person')
        self.placing_down('person', 'safe position')
        self.current_state = 'ENSURE_COMFORT'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def ensure_comfort_state(self):
        # Ensure the person is comfortable and safe
        self.checking('person comfort')
        self.arranging('pillows')
        self.monitoring('person condition')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the situation until help arrives
        if self.is_additional_help_needed():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.monitoring('person')

    # Action / Annotation methods
    def check_person_condition(self):
        # Check if the person is conscious and can communicate
        return self.monitoring('person condition')

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Make a call to emergency services or caretakers
        self.calling('emergency services')

    def is_additional_help_needed(self):
        # Determine if more help is needed based on the person's condition
        return self.monitoring('person', 'additional help needed')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Instantiate and run the butler robot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

This code defines a class `ButlerRobotFSM` with various states and transitions relevant to the given scenario. Each state represents a specific action or check the robot must perform, and transitions are determined based on the situation's assessment. The robot starts in the 'INITIAL' state and progresses through the states based on the situation's needs. The `run` method continuously updates the robot's state, ensuring it responds appropriately to the evolving situation.
