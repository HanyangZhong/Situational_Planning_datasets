To create a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a butler robot in the described scenario, we'll follow a similar structure to your example but tailor the states and actions to address the specific tasks related to managing medication, ensuring safety, and tidying up the living area. The FSM will involve states that reflect the assessment of the situation, organizing medication, cleaning the area, and ensuring the wellbeing of the elderly person.

Here's an implementation in Python:

```python
class MedicationManagementRobot:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states of the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'ORGANIZE_MEDICATION': self.organize_medication_state,
            'CLEAN_AREA': self.clean_area_state,
            'CHECK_WELLBEING': self.check_wellbeing_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Initialize the current state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Start with assessing the situation
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the state of the medication and living area
        if self.is_medication_disorganized():
            self.current_state = 'ORGANIZE_MEDICATION'
        elif self.is_area_messy():
            self.current_state = 'CLEAN_AREA'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CHECK_WELLBEING'

    def organize_medication_state(self):
        # Organize the medication
        self.collecting('medication bottles')
        self.arranging('medication in organizer')
        self.current_state = 'CLEAN_AREA'

    def clean_area_state(self):
        # Clean the living area
        self.wiping('spilled water')
        self.folding('newspaper')
        self.current_state = 'CHECK_WELLBEING'

    def check_wellbeing_state(self):
        # Check on the elderly person's wellbeing
        if self.is_elderly_person_needing_help():
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if needed
        self.calling('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for conditions and actions
    def is_medication_disorganized(self):
        return self.checking('medication organization')

    def is_area_messy(self):
        return self.monitoring('living area', 'cleanliness')

    def is_elderly_person_needing_help(self):
        return self.monitoring('elderly person', 'wellbeing')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the robot and run it
medication_robot = MedicationManagementRobot()
medication_robot.run()
```

This code provides a structured approach for the robot to manage the medication, clean the area, and ensure the wellbeing of the elderly person. Each state corresponds to a specific task or assessment, and transitions between states are based on the conditions met in each situation. The helper methods (e.g., `is_medication_disorganized`, `is_area_messy`, `is_elderly_person_needing_help`) represent the robot's sensors and decision-making processes. The actions (e.g., `collecting`, `arranging`, `wiping`, `folding`, `calling`) are the robot's physical interactions with the environment.
