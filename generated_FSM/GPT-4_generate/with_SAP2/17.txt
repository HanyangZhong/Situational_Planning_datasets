To create a finite state machine (FSM) in Python for a butler robot that addresses the specific scenario of a young child near an unsecured staircase, we'll define different states that correspond to the robot's actions in response to the situation. The FSM will include states like assessing the situation, securing the child, and ensuring safety, among others.

Here's an example of how the code might look:

```python
class ButlerRobotFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the states in the FSM
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'SECURE_CHILD': self.secure_child_state,
            'ENSURE_SAFETY': self.ensure_safety_state,
            'MONITOR_SITUATION': self.monitor_situation_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # Set the initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial state. Start with situation assessment.
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess if the child is in immediate danger.
        if self.is_child_near_staircase():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_CHILD'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def secure_child_state(self):
        # Secure the child away from the staircase.
        self.reaching('child')
        self.transporting('child', 'safe area')
        self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def ensure_safety_state(self):
        # Ensure that the area around the staircase is safe.
        self.checking('staircase safety')
        self.arranging('safety barriers')
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_SITUATION'

    def monitor_situation_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child's safety.
        if self.is_child_in_danger():
            self.current_state = 'SECURE_CHILD'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if the situation is beyond the robot's capability.
        self.calling('human assistance')
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Action methods
    def is_child_near_staircase(self):
        # Check if the child is near the staircase
        return self.monitoring('child', 'staircase')

    def is_child_in_danger(self):
        # Monitor if the child is in any danger
        return self.monitoring('child', 'danger')

    # Run the FSM loop
    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Instantiate and run the ButlerRobot FSM
butler_robot = ButlerRobotFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this code, the robot has a series of states it can be in, each representing a different phase of its response to the situation. The robot begins by assessing the situation, then secures the child if necessary, ensures the safety of the area, monitors the situation, and calls for help if needed. The action methods (`is_child_near_staircase`, `is_child_in_danger`) would be implemented to use the robot's sensors and logic to evaluate the situation.
