 Here is my analysis of the FSMs:

FSM 1_1:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers most necessary states like assessing situation, cleaning floor, arranging items. Does not have an explicit state for monitoring after cleaning.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions between states, but does not check on ongoing cleanliness.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simple linear state transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Checks wet floor situation, but no other safety checks. 

5. Scalability: 6 - Additional states can be added, but transitions may get complex.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Functional interface, follows some natural sequences.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses most applicable actions like mopping, wiping, etc.

Overall Score: 6.7

FSM 1_2:

1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers assessment, all issue handling and sanitization.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Good transitions and returns to assess state.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simple linear state machine.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Checks on hazards but no active prevention.

5. Scalability: 7 - Additional states can be added reasonably easily.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Decent interface following expected sequences. 

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Leverages most relevant actions well.

Overall Score: 7.3

FSM 1_3:

1. State Coverage: 9 - Handles assessment, cleaning, arrangement and finish.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Robust transitions between appropriate states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Some interconnections between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Checks for hazards.

5. Scalability: 8 - Structure allows additional states to be added.

6. Assistance UX: 8 - Contextual state sequence and transitions. 

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Good usage of provided action verbs.

Overall Score: 8

FSM 1_4:

1. State Coverage: 7 - Misses some aspects like defogging mirror.

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Transitions are reasonable but holes remain. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Mostly linear transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Some safety checks but not comprehensive.

5. Scalability: 7 - Additional states can be accommodated.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Decent sequence but lacks some expected actions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses most relevant verbs correctly.

Overall Score: 6.6

In summary, FSM 1_3 has the highest overall benchmark score of 8 out of 10. It has strong coverage of necessary states, good transition connectivity between them, some built-in complexity, decent safety checks and assistance UX, easy scalability and leverages the standard action set appropriately.

FSM 1_2 comes second with a score of 7.3. It also has good state coverage and actions, but is simpler, has gaps in safety and UX. 

FSM 1_1 needs more monitoring and prevention functionality but is otherwise competent. FSM 1_4 misses key aspects like defogging the mirror which lowers its score.
