 Here is my analysis of the FSMs in code content "2_1", "2_2", "2_3", and "2_4" compared to the benchmark "2_best":

FSM 2_1:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like recognizing hazard, cleaning up, monitoring. Does not explicitly handle other hazards.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Transitions cover likely sequences, but no transitions back to monitoring from turning off stove.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear structure with monitoring state in middle.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes cleaning up spill first. No securing of environment.

5. Scalability: 6 - Additional states would fit, but transitions may get complex.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, not much personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses checking, grabbing, mopping and other actions from list.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4

FSM 2_2:

1. State Coverage: 6 - Handles spill, but no preparation or post actions.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Transitions cover basic flow. No contingency transitions. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very linear structure.

4. Safety Mindset: 5 - Focuses only on cleaning spill. No safety steps.

5. Scalability: 7 - Simple structure makes additional states easy to add.

6. Assistance UX: 3 - Very robotic print statements only.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Uses several actions like gripping, lifting, placing down.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.6

FSM 2_3:  

1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers assessment, cleaning, monitoring very well.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Contingency transitions from monitoring back to cleanup.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Three straightforward states.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Prioritize spill cleanup and continuous rechecking.  

5. Scalability: 7 - Additional states can be inserted easily.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Functionally structured, not personalized.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Checking, wiping, disposing align with actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.1

FSM 2_4:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Phased approach covers major steps. No preparation.  

2. Transition Coverage: 9 - Fully connected progression through states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linear flow, assess state in middle is only interconnect.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Securing floor and full inspection addressed.

5. Scalability: 8 - Structure facilitates extending states as needed.

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very functional print statements.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Uses reaching, gripping, mopping and other actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.3

In summary, FSM 2_3 has the best coverage of spill response states and safety mindset. FSM 2_4 offers great extensibility and alignments with benchmark actions. But overall 2_4 edges out as the closest match to the ideal benchmark example. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on my analysis!
