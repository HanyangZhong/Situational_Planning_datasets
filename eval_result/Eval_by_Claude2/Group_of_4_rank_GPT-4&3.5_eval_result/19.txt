 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs compared to the example "19_best" FSM:

FSM 1 Analysis:
1. State Coverage: 5 - Covers some key states like assessing situation, distracting child, moving pot, but misses some critical states like monitoring child safety.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Reasonably good transition coverage between states.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Some interconnectivity between states but could be denser. 
4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Tries to address safety by distraction and moving pot, but safety not fully ensured.
5. Scalability: 7 - Structure is reasonably modular for extensions.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Some good actions like distracting child, but could be more natural.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Mostly uses actions from standard set, only introduces "collecting" additionally.
Overall Score: 6.3

FSM 2 Analysis: 
1. State Coverage: 4 - Only assesses situation, grabs child, moves child, calls for help. Major gaps.
2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Transitions are simplistic, does not cover likely sequences well.  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very linear, lacks interconnectivity between states.
4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Tries to move child to safety.
5. Scalability: 5 - Hard to extend without refactoring structure.
6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very rigid, lacks personalization.  
7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Strictly uses action verbs from list.
Overall Score: 5.1  

FSM 3 Analysis:
1. State Coverage: 4 - Covers reaching out and stopping child but misses prep and follow-up.
2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Handles core scenario very linearly.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Lacks interconnectivity between states. 
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to stop child from reaching.
5. Scalability: 5 - Hard to extend functionality within structure.
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Interactions are simple and lack context.
7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Does not introduce any custom actions.  
Overall Score: 5.6

FSM 4 Analysis: 
1. State Coverage: 7 - Checks stove, reaching, alerts danger, helps - good coverage.
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Attempts to cover likely sequences.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Some interconnectivity but could be denser.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Alerts danger and calls for help.  
5. Scalability: 8 - Structure is modular for extensions.
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Interactions are basic without personalization.
7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Strictly uses action list vocabulary.   
Overall Score: 7.0

To summarize, FSM 1 has the highest overall benchmark score of 6.3 with reasonably good state coverage, transitions and safety mindset. FSM 4 scores 7.0 with its modular structure but has lower UX. FSM 2 and 3 are more limited in coverage and complexity. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
