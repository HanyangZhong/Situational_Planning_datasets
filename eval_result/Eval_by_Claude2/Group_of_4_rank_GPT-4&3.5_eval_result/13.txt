 Based on the scoring dimensions you provided, here is my analysis of the additional FSMs:

13_1:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers the key states but does not monitor after informing the woman
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Generally good coverage but lacks transitions back to assessing after informing woman  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Relatively simple with linear transitions
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Removes chemicals before informing woman but does not continuously monitor
5. Scalability: 6 - Some encapsulation but tightly couples states and actions
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Informs woman but does not provide personalized and contextual interactions
7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Generally aligns with defined action set but introduces some new actions like "transporting"

Overall Score: 6.7

13_2:  

1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers all major states 
2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Good coverage of transitions
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Moderately interconnected states
4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Continuously monitors safety
5. Scalability: 7 - Some reusable components but state transitions are coupled
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Informs on risk but interactions are robotic
7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Almost completely aligns with defined action set

Overall Score: 7.7  

13_3:

1. State Coverage: 7 - Handles main states but lacks depth  
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Transitions present but not fully connected
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Relatively linear state transitions  
4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Removes hazard but does not continuously monitor
5. Scalability: 5 - Tightly couples states and actions, limiting reusability
6. Assistance UX: 7 - Informs woman of actions but interactions are scripted
7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Diverges from action set with custom actions 

Overall Score: 5.7

13_4:

1. State Coverage: 5 - Only assesses situation and covers chemicals, lacks depth
2. Transition Coverage: 3 - Very linear transitions with no loops  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Minimal interconnectivity between states
4. Safety Mindset: 4 - Covers chemicals temporarily but does not monitor  
5. Scalability: 3 - Very tightly coupled to specific hazard, not generalizable   
6. Assistance UX: 2 - Provides no information or reassurance to occupant  
7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Uses some actions from standard set but also introduces custom actions

Overall Score: 3.4

In summary, 13_2 has the best coverage of states, transitions and safety mindset. 13_1 also covers the key states and actions decently. 13_3 handles some basics but lacks depth and reusability. 13_4 focuses very narrowly on covering chemicals, without broader situation assessment or occupant interaction.
