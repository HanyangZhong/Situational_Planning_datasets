 Here are my scores, analysis, and reasoning for the additional FSMs ("14_1", "14_2", "14_3", "14_4") compared to the benchmark "14_best" FSM:

14_1 FSM:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers most key states like assess situation, remove hazard, monitor, and call for help. Does not explicitly handle scenarios if cat ingests toxic food.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions between states, but does not cover potential emergency with cat ingesting toxic food.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear transitions between a few key states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Proactively removes hazards and monitors situation. Lacks emergency response if cat ingests toxins.  

5. Scalability: 8 - Reasonably modular design should allow adding states/transitions.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Mostly responsive but lacks personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages many defined actions like grasping, serving etc. But also uses some custom actions.

Overall Score: 7.0

14_2 FSM: 

1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers key states to monitor, remove hazards, relocate cat, secure area and alert owner.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Handles transitions quite completely.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Several interconnected states with conditional transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Strong monitoring and hazard removal. Alerts owner.

5. Scalability: 7 - Tightly couples some states, may resist extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Structured but not personalized interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Almost exclusively uses defined action set.

Overall Score: 7.7

14_3 FSM:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Defines necessary states to assess, help cat, monitor, call for help.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Covers key transitions, but lacks complexity.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Fairly linear with simple branching logic.  

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Focused on helping cat by removing hazards, distraction.

5. Scalability: 7 - Simple structure, additional states can extend capability.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Helper robot use cases lend to structured interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Mix of custom verbs and standard actions.  

Overall Score: 7.0


14_4 FSM: 

1. State Coverage: 9 - Key states check distance, engage cat, remove hazards, call for help.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Conditionally transitions between the key states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Several interconnected states with branching logic.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Prioritizes engaging cat, removing hazards.

5. Scalability: 8 - Clean abstraction allows additional states.

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Mix of helper use cases and personalized interactions.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages standard action verbs, few custom.

Overall Score: 8.0
