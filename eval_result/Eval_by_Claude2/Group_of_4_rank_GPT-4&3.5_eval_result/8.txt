 Here are detailed benchmark scores and analysis for the additional FSMs compared to the example "8_best":

FSM 8_1:
1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states but lacks detail for more complex scenarios 
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Connects states reasonably well
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Fairly simple interconnectivity between states 
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Considers safety but no final check
5. Scalability: 5 - Hardcoded states resist extension  
6. Assistance UX: 4 - Limited contextual interactions  
7. Action Set Alignment: 2 - Uses custom actions instead of standard vocabulary
Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7

FSM 8_2:  
1. State Coverage: 7 - Handles key aspects but gaps for safety checks  
2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Connects most relevant states
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Generally linear transitions
4. Safety Mindset: 5 - Focuses more on procedures than safety
5. Scalability: 7 - Modular states aid extension
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Some awareness of user context   
7. Action Set Alignment: 1 - Entirely custom actions
Overall Benchmark Score: 5.4

FSM 8_3:
1. State Coverage: 5 - Covers closer of drawer but omits details
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Connects somewhat logically  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Strictly linear transitions 
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes safety at points  
5. Scalability: 3 - States are broad, resist detailed extension
6. Assistance UX: 3 - Minimal situational awareness 
7. Action Set Alignment: 0 - No alignment with standard actions
Overall Benchmark Score: 3.4 

FSM 8_4:  
1. State Coverage: 9 - Thoroughly covers risk scenarios
2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Models likely event sequences 
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Generally linear with some branches 
4. Safety Mindset: 10 - Core focus on safety and monitoring
5. Scalability: 8 - Abstracts complexity for modular extension   
6. Assistance UX: 8 - Contextual interactions   
7. Action Set Alignment: 0 - Uses all custom actions
Overall Benchmark Score: 6.6

In summary, FSM 8_1 has fairly good coverage but lacks safety checks and uses custom actions. FSM 8_2 focuses more on procedures over safety. FSM 8_3 is basic in coverage but prioritizes safety. FSM 8_4 has the best safety mindset but uses no standard actions. Comparing to the ideal "8_best", there are opportunities for these FSMs to improve state coverage, transitions, scalability, UX, and action alignment.
