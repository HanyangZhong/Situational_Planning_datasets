 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs compared to the example "18_best" code:

**FSM 1 (18_1)**

State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, engaging child, covering outlet. Does not have explicit state for ensuring child safety. 

Transition Coverage: 7 - Generally good transitions, but lacks fallbacks if child ignores engagement.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simpler interconnectivity focused just on key states.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to cover outlet and engage child, but lacks ensuring safety.  

Scalability: 6 - Structure is decent but transitions need enhancement for extendibility.

Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, but no personalization or natural interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses checking, monitoring, grasping, placing down, collecting, delivering, calling for help actions from standard set.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7**

**FSM 2 (18_2)**

State Coverage: 7 - Key states around assessing, removing child, covering outlet. No explicit safety check.

Transition Coverage: 6 - Handles basic situations but lacks complexity for extensions.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Simplistic interconnectivity of states.

Safety Mindset: 5 - Removes child but does not ensure full safety.

Scalability: 5 - Very rigid structure, will require overhaul for new contexts.

Assistance UX: 3 - Mostly just moves child away without engagement.  

Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses monitoring, lifting, placing, grasping, inserting, calling for help from action set.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3**


**FSM 3 (18_3)**

State Coverage: 9 - Covers assessment, outlet coverage, play monitoring, engagement, help calling. 

Transition Coverage: 8 - Handles likely sequences of states well.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Balanced interconnectivity complexity.

Safety Mindset: 9 - Strong focus on safety with transitions.

Scalability: 8 - Encapsulates complexity for easier extensions.  

Assistance UX: 7 - Attempts child engagement and reminders.

Action Set Alignment: 5 - Uses some actions like covering, reminding, calling for help. But mainly custom actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 7.6**

**FSM 4 (18_4)** 

State Coverage: 6 - Basic states for assessment, engagement, monitoring. Lacks depth.

Transition Coverage: 5 - Handles some sequences but lacks complexity.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very linear state transitions.  

Safety Mindset: 6 - Tries to engage child but no safety checks.

Scalability: 4 - Rigid structure, hard to extend for new contexts. 

Assistance UX: 4 - Very functional engagement without personalization.

Action Set Alignment: 2 - Does not leverage any standard actions. Uses all custom actions. 

**Overall Benchmark Score: 4.3**

In summary, FSM 3 has the most balanced and safety focused design. FSM 1 provides decent coverage but needs more transitions. FSM 2 and 4 lack complexity. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
