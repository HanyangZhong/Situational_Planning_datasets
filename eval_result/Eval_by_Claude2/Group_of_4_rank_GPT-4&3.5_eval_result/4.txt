 Here are my analysis and scores for the FSMs, compared to the benchmark FSM (4_best):

FSM 4_1:
State Coverage: 8 - Covers most necessary states but lacks monitoring/verification after actions are taken
Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent coverage but some gaps in transitions like from turn lights on state 
Complexity: 5 - Intermediate complexity with unidirectional flow
Safety Mindset: 6 - Takes safety actions but no verification of success
Scalability: 7 - Reasonably encapsulated but state methods do complex work  
UX: 6 - Task-focused interactions but not personalized
Action Alignment: 8 - Uses many actions from standard set with some custom actions

Overall Score: 6.7

FSM 4_2:
State Coverage: 7 - Lacks end state and rigorous monitoring
Transition Coverage: 6 - Major gaps like no fallback if actions fail 
Complexity: 4 - Mostly linear transitions
Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to mitigate risks but no help if fails
Scalability: 6 - Some encapsulation but state methods do heavy work
UX: 5 - Very functional, not human-centric  
Action Alignment: 9 - Leverages standard action vocabulary

Overall Score: 6.3

FSM 4_3:
State Coverage: 9 - Covers key states, only lacks stove shutdown
Transition Coverage: 8 - Good coverage, handles failure scenarios
Complexity: 6 - Web of transitions but not maximal  
Safety Mindset: 8 - Verifies and tries to resolve risks 
Scalability: 8 - Abstractions enable extensions
UX: 7 - Notifies user but interactions lack personalization  
Action Alignment: 10 - Strictly sticks to standard action vocabulary

Overall Score: 8.0

FSM 4_4: 
State Coverage: 5 - Lacks post-action assessment and end state 
Transition Coverage: 4 - Major gaps like no failure handling
Complexity: 2 - Strictly linear transitions  
Safety Mindset: 6 - Mitigates risks but cannot call for help itself
Scalability: 7 - Reasonable abstractions for extensions
UX: 3 - Very mechanical, no personalized interactions
Action Alignment: 7 - Mixes standard actions with custom cover flame action

Overall Score: 4.9

To summarize, FSM 4_3 scores the highest overall by thoroughly handling risk states, verifying actions, maintaining abstraction, and staying within the standard action vocabulary. FSM 4_1 covers major states but lacks transitions, while FSM 4_2 does not gracefully handle failures. FSM 4_4 is basic, omitting key states and transitions required to robustly assist in the kitchen scene. Please let me know if you need any clarification or additional comparison details!
