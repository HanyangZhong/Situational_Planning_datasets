 Here is my analysis of the FSMs:

FSM 1 ("22_1"):

1. State Coverage: 6/10 - Covers some necessary states like monitoring, alerting, assisting, but lacks assessment/diagnosis states

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Transitions cover some key sequences, but lacks complexity for additional scenarios

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2/10 - Very linear/simple state transitions  

4. Safety Mindset: 4/10 - Attempts to assist the woman but no mechanisms to call for advanced help

5. Scalability: 6/10 - Additional states/transitions could be added but would require refactoring

6. Assistance UX: 4/10 - Fairly robotic, simple interactions with the woman

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses reaching, pressing, monitoring actions from standard set

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.9/10


FSM 2 ("22_2"):  

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Checks situation, reaches/presses button, calls for help

2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Has transitions for key scenarios, but lacks complexity  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Simple linear state transitions

4. Safety Mindset: 6/10 - Calls for help but lacks mechanisms for advanced assistance

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Additional states could be integrated with some effort  

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Interactions with woman not specified

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Leverages reaching, pressing actions from standard set

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.1/10


FSM 3 ("22_3"):

1. State Coverage: 5/10 - Assesses situation, reaches button, calls for help - lacks depth

2. Transition Coverage: 4/10 - Very simple transitions between a few states

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2/10 - Minimal interconnectedness between states  

4. Safety Mindset: 6/10 - Calls for help but lacks nuanced assistance 

5. Scalability: 5/10 - Very simple structure resists extension to new states

6. Assistance UX: 4/10 - Only high-level interactions described  

7. Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Uses reaching, calling actions from standard vocabulary

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.7/10


FSM 4 ("22_4"):

1. State Coverage: 6/10 - Checks situation, attempts reach, calls for help - misses some areas  

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Has transitions for basic scenario, lacks complexity

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2/10 - Largely linear state transitions  

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Calls for emergency help but minimal assistance provided

5. Scalability: 6/10 - Additional states could be added with refactoring  

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Functional but lacks personalization 

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Leverages reaching, calling from standard action set

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.6/10

In summary, FSM 2 has the highest overall benchmark score of 6.1/10. It covers more of the necessary states and transitions, aligns well with the standard action set, and provides basic mechanisms for assistance and calling for additional help when needed. The other FSMs are more limited in state coverage, transition complexity, safety assistance, and scalability. But all of them have room for improvement to better match the full capabilities shown in the "22_best" example FSM provided. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
