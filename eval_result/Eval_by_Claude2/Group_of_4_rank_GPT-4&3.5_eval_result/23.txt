 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs, scoring them across the 7 dimensions relative to the "23_best" example:

FSM 23_1:
1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, calming dog, engaging child, monitoring play. Lacks distinct safety check state.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Generally good connectivity between states, but lacks transitions back to monitoring if safety ensured after intervention. 
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Reasonably interconnected states without too much density.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Attempts to calm dog and remind child of safety, but no distinct safety state.
5. Scalability: 8 - Fairly modular state design enabling extensions.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Some positive engagements with child and dog, but interactions could be more personalized.  
7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses a broad mix of defined actions like responding, reminding, gathering, delivering.

Overall Score: 7.0

FSM 23_2: 
1. State Coverage: 6 - Covers monitoring and calling for help, but lacks mechanisms to directly intervene in rough play.
2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Generally connects states, but transitions only based on play roughness, lacking distinct safety checks.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Relatively linear state transitions without much density.
4. Safety Mindset: 4 - Indirectly attempts to improve safety through distractions, without direct intervention.
5. Scalability: 7 - Reasonably encapsulated states support additional extensions.
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Distractions could help, but interactions lack situational context.
7. Action Set Alignment: 6 - Leverages some reference actions like collecting, delivering.

Overall Score: 5.3  

FSM 23_3:
1. State Coverage: 7 - Checks play safety and offers alternatives, but no direct ability to intervene.
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Covers key states, but lacks robustness in handling risky play.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Mostly linear state transitions without density.
4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Attempts indirect diversions but no mechanisms to directly intervene. 
5. Scalability: 7 - Modular states could enable extensions.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Friendly interactions with the children, but lacking situational awareness.
7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Limited alignment with reference action vocabulary.

Overall Score: 6.0

FSM 23_4: 
1. State Coverage: 8 - Assesses play safety and engages interaction. Separate call for help.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Covers key transitions, but lacks robustness in adversarial situations.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Intermediate interconnection between states.
4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Direct mechanisms to intervene and ensure safety.
5. Scalability: 7 - Encapsulates complexity fairly well.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Engages play participants but could be more personalized.
7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Samples useful reference actions like grasping, pulling.

Overall Score: 7.0

In summary, FSM 23_1 has the highest overall benchmark score of 7.0 thanks to reasonably strong coverage of key states, safety mechanisms, and reference action alignment. FSM 23_4 also scores a 7.0 with direct safety interventions. FSM 23_2 lags at 5.3 due to indirect safety approaches, while FSM 23_3 falls short at 6.0 because of limited capabilities to directly intervene if play becomes too risky.
