 Here is my analysis of the FSMs:

FSM 15_1:

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers the key states like identifying hazards, fixing/removing hazards, and monitoring cat. But lacks transitions back to hazard identification after actions.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Transitions generally cover likely sequences, but no loops back to re-checking after actions.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Some interconnectivity between states but quite linear in structure.

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Clear focus on identifying and mitigating safety hazards.

5. Scalability: 6/10 - Additional hazard types would require new states, so only moderately extensible.

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very functional but not personalized or contextual interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses relevant actions like gripping, lifting, carrying, but also includes some custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.0


FSM 15_2:

1. State Coverage: 9/10 - Checks area, handles hazards, monitors cat. Loops back to re-check area.  

2. Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Checks transitions in likely order, loops back appropriately.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Some interconnections between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Focused on mitigating hazards around cat.

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Structure makes adding new hazards straightforward.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - Functional, could improve contextual awareness.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Closely aligns with defined action vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.0


FSM 15_3:

1. State Coverage: 9/10 - Assesses situation, handles hazards, marks completion.

2. Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Branches to hazard handling, loops back to reassess. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Fairly linear structure with some branches.

4. Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Addresses safety hazards.

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Additional states would fit structure reasonably well.

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Handles tasks, but interactions are not personalized.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Uses consistent action vocabulary.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.3


FSM 15_4:  

1. State Coverage: 8/10 – Assesses, handles hazards, completion state.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 – Checks and branches, but linear handling.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 – Minimal interconnectivity between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 – Clear focus on hazard identification and mitigation. 

5. Scalability: 7/10 – Structure not overly rigid, additional states could extend.

6. Assistance UX: 8/10 – Prints status updates for good communication.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 – Terminology aligns well with standard actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.6
