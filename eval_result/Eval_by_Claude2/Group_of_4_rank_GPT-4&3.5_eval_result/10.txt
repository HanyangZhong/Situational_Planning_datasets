 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided:

FSM 10_1:
State Coverage: 8 - Covers most key states like assessing the situation, moving the chair, and monitoring if further help is needed. No explicit safety states.
Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent connectivity between states, but lacks fallback transitions if actions fail.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simplistic linear transitions between a few key states.
Safety Mindset: 6 - Implicitly avoids harm by keeping path clear, but no safety states. 
Scalability: 7 - Additional states can be inserted without major rework.
Assistance UX: 6 - Functional assistance is provided but interactions lack personalization.
Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses a mix of checking, grasping, dragging, releasing, monitoring, calling aligned with standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

FSM 10_2:
State Coverage: 7 - Key states of checking path and moving chair covered. No safety states.
Transition Coverage: 6 - Checks chair position after moving but lacks failure handling transitions.  
Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Very linear movement between states.
Safety Mindset: 5 - Focuses on clearing path but safety is not explicit.
Scalability: 6 - Additional states would require transitions to be reworked.
Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional without personalization.
Action Set Alignment: 9 - Primary actions strictly adhere to the defined action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0  

FSM 10_3:  
State Coverage: 8 - Has states to assess, move obstacle, clear path, and finish task.
Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent connectivity between key states.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear transitions.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Ensures path cleared before proceeding.
Scalability: 8 - Additional states can be inserted cleanly.  
Assistance UX: 7 - Checks if obstacle is reachable before moving.
Action Set Alignment: 10 - Actions fully align with standard vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.4

FSM 10_4:
State Coverage: 8 - Necessary states of assess, move, clear path, reach desk covered.  
Transition Coverage: 7 - Connects between key states, lacks failure handling transitions.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linear movement between states.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Checks for obstacles before assisting person.
Scalability: 8 - Additional states can be added easily.
Assistance UX: 7 - Considers if obstacle is present before taking action.  
Action Set Alignment: 10 - Actions strictly adhere to benchmark list.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.6

In summary, FSM 10_4 scores the highest at 7.6, followed by 10_3 and 10_1. FSM 10_2 has the lowest overall benchmark score at 6.0. The key strengths and weaknesses center around state coverage, transition handling, scalability, safety, and action alignment. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
