 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided:

FSM 1 ("17_1"):

State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers key states like monitoring, engaging child, and blocking stairs, but does not handle ensuring safety after actions taken.

Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Transitions cover likely sequences, but no fallbacks if actions fail.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Simplistic linear state transitions.

Safety Mindset: 6/10 - Attempts to block stairs, but no confirmation of safety.

Scalability: 7/10 - Additional states can be inserted as needed.

Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very task-focused interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses 8 verbs from standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7/10


FSM 2 ("17_2"):  

State Coverage: 7/10 - Covers assessing situation, moving child, calling for help, but no ensuring safety.

Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Handles failures to block stairs or move child.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Multiple branches based on state assessments.

Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Tries to move child to safety. 

Scalability: 8/10 - Additional complexity encapsulated in states.

Assistance UX: 6/10 - Very functional interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Uses 9 verbs from standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.4/10


FSM 3 ("17_3"):

State Coverage: 5/10 - Handles only calling for help and opening windows. Major gaps.

Transition Coverage: 4/10 - No fallbacks if actions fail. Very linear.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Strictly linear state transitions.

Safety Mindset: 6/10 - Tries to open windows and call for help.

Scalability: 5/10 - Hard to extend without refactoring states.

Assistance UX: 3/10 - Purely functional.  

Action Set Alignment: 2/10 - Only uses 2 verbs from standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.1/10


FSM 4 ("17_4"):

State Coverage: 9/10 - Covers all key states to handle situation. Only missing confirmation of safety.  

Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Monitors child continuously, but no failure handling.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Branches based on state assessments.   

Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Gets safety gate and monitors child.

Scalability: 8/10 - Additional complexity encapsulated.

Assistance UX: 7/10 - Mix of functional and personal interactions.  

Action Set Alignment: 10/10 - Uses 10 verbs from the standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.0/10
