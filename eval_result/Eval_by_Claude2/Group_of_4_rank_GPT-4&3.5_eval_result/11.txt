 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided compared to the benchmark "11_best" FSM:

FSM 11_1:
State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers main states but lacks detail for ensure comfort and continuous monitoring.  
Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Main transitions covered but lacks some edges for error handling.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Overall fairly simple interconnectivity between states.
Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Tries to ensure patient need met but lacks monitoring/assistance.  
Scalability: 6/10 - Structure is decent but state names need more abstraction.
Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very functional, but not personalized or contextual interactions.  
Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Leverages many of the defined action verbs but lacks some details.
**Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7/10**

FSM 11_2: 
State Coverage: 7/10 - Covers core states, but lacks refinement.
Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Decent transitions, but lacks error handling.  
Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10 - Simplistic state interconnectivity.
Safety Mindset: 5/10 - Can call for help but lacks robustness.
Scalability: 7/10 - States are abstracted reasonably well.  
Assistance UX: 3/10 - Very rigid, robotic interactions.
Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Good use of some action verbs.
**Overall Benchmark Score: 5.6/10**

FSM 11_3:
State Coverage: 6/10 - Misses some key states for medicine delivery.
Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Transitions are fairly linear.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Lacks complex state interconnections.  
Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Can identify issues and call for help.   
Scalability: 5/10 - States are specific vs. abstracted.
Assistance UX: 4/10 - Functional but not very fluid.  
Action Set Alignment: 2/10 - Mostly custom actions vs. standard verbs.
**Overall Benchmark Score: 4.7/10** 

FSM 11_4:  
State Coverage: 7/10 - Has core states but needs more refinement.
Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Transitions are incomplete.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10 - Direct state transitions only.
Safety Mindset: 6/10 - Can call for help if needed.  
Scalability: 8/10 - States are abstracted nicely.
Assistance UX: 2/10 - No context, personalization. 
Action Set Alignment: 1/10 - Placeholder actions only.
**Overall Benchmark Score: 4.6/10**

In summary, FSM 11_1 has the highest overall benchmark score of 6.7/10 when compared to the ideal "11_best" FSM. It covers more states, transitions, leverages more standard actions, and encapsulates complexity better than the other additional FSMs analyzed.
