 Here are my scoring and analysis of the additional FSMs (16_1 to 16_4) against 16_best:

16_1:
1. State Coverage: 8/10 - It has key states like assessing situation, clearing counter, engaging child, monitoring. But lacks finer handling like checking child response to engagement.
2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Key transitions are there, but lacks transitions like re-engaging child if distraction fails.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Relatively simple with no complexity in transitions. 
4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Proactively clears counter and engages child. No backup if engagement fails.
5. Scalability: 7/10 - Structure is decent but transitions are limiting.
6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - Functional but could be more personalized and contextual.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses mainly actions from defined set. Introduces 'reminding' which aligns well.

Overall Score: 7.3/10

16_2:
1. State Coverage: 9/10 - Has key states, though simplify situation check.
2. Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Handles key scenarios though optimize further.  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10 - Some interconnectivity but quite linear.
4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Prioritizes moving child first.
5. Scalability: 8/10 - Structure allows extensions.
6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Purely functional, lacks personalization.
7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Uses vocabulary appropriately.

Overall Score: 7.7/10


16_3:
1. State Coverage: 9/10 - Most critical states covered well. Can detail assess situation more.  
2. Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Key scenarios mapped, misses some unlikely cases.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Allows new states to embed easily.  
4. Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Approaches and protects child. Backups not automated.
5. Scalability: 7/10 - Additional states can plug in with some effort.
6. Assistance UX: 7/10 - Personalizes warnings to child. Scope for improvement. 
7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Uses vocabulary well, introduces 'warning'.

Overall Score: 8/10


16_4: 
1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Misses finer handling like verifying child safety.   
2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Only linear transitions based on conditions.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Simplistic linear structure.
4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Can get trapped monitoring unresponsive child. 
5. Scalability: 4/10 - Strong dependencies resist extension.
6. Assistance UX: 4/10 - Lacks situational personalization.
7. Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Aligned vocabulary with placeholders.

Overall Score: 5.6/10

In summary, 16_3 has the best coverage and flexibility, though has scope to further enrich transitions. 16_1 takes proactive safety steps but needs child response handling. 16_2 prioritizes well sequentially but can personalize more. 16_4 has a linear structure lacking state details and interconnectivity.
