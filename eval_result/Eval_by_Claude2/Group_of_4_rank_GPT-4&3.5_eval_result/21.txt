 Here are the detailed analysis and scores for the additional FSMs:

FSM 1:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like checking situation, reaching/pressing button, calling for help. But lacks states for providing interim assistance.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions between states, but no fallbacks if call for help fails.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simplistic linear state transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Tries to call for help but no contingency.

5. Scalability: 4 - Hardcoded for current scenario, not extendable.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very robotic, presses button without context.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses reaching, pressing, calling for help from standard actions.


Overall Benchmark Score: 6.1


FSM 2: 

1. State Coverage: 7 - Checks situation and calls for help but lacks nuanced assistance.

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Transitions focused on help button press.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Linear state machine.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Ensures help button is pressed.

5. Scalability: 5 - Hardcoded based on current context.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Presses button without personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Leverages defined actions like checking, moving and pressing.


Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4


FSM 3:

1. State Coverage: 7 - Assesses situation and calls for help but minimal assistance. 

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Covers key states but transitions are simplistic.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Largely linear state machine.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to reach help button.

5. Scalability: 6 - Retrieves wheelchair so extendable.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Feels robotic with lack of context.

7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Strictly uses checking for assessments.


Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7


FSM 4:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Assesses situation, reaches for help, calls for assistance.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Handles core scenario but lacks nuanced branches.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simplistic linear state transitions. 

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Ensures help button is pressed.

5. Scalability: 6 - Hardcoded based on current context.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Presses button without personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Leverages reaching, pressing and calling for help.


Overall Benchmark Score: 7

In summary, FSM 3 has the highest overall benchmark score of 6.7, while FSM 1 has the lowest score of 6.1. But all the additional FSMs are simpler with more linear state transitions compared to the "21_best" example which would score 10s across the dimensions.
