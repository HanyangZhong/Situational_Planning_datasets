 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided:

FSM 7_1:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers most key states like assessing, cleaning, arranging, fixing, checking. Does not have explicit safety/monitoring states.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Transitions are linear without flexibility. Does not adapt based on changes.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Fixed linear sequence of states.

4. Safety Mindset: 4 - No explicit safety states but attempts to clean and arrange to prevent harm.

5. Scalability: 4 - Structure is rigid, may be difficult to extend.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Functional, but interactions are simple and robotic.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses relevant actions like cleaning, arranging, fixing. Minimal custom actions. 

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3

FSM 7_2:

1. State Coverage: 6 - Covers assessing, picking up items, arranging items. Lacks safety and monitoring.

2. Transition Coverage: 4 - Minimal transitions based solely on hallway state.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Very linear structure.

4. Safety Mindset: 3 - Attempts to clean up but safety is not a priority. 

5. Scalability: 5 - Reasonably extensible but state transitions are limiting.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Decent UX with item interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages most relevant actions like gripping, lifting, placing.

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.9

FSM 7_3:

1. State Coverage: 9 - Thorough states for assessing, evaluating, cleaning up, fixing, monitoring.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Adaptive transitions based on environment sensing. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Increased interconnectivity between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Clear focus on safety and monitoring.

5. Scalability: 7 - Well encapsulated behaviors, conducive to extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Contextual interactions by evaluating and responding.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Closely aligns to expected action vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.9

FSM 7_4:

1. State Coverage: 7 - Has assessment, navigation, cleanup, alert states. Lacks depth.

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Adapts based on environment sensing.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Some flexibility between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Alert state considers safety.

5. Scalability: 8 - Clear structure makes adding states and transitions easier. 

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Functional but simple, robotic interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Usage of custom actions rather than standard vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0

In summary, FSM 7_3 has the highest overall benchmark score of 7.9 owing to its strong coverage of necessary states, adaptive transition structure, increased complexity, safety considerations, scalability, human-centric UX, and action alignment. FSM 7_1 has the lowest score of 5.3 due to gaps in state coverage, rigid transitions, low complexity, average safety mindset, difficult scalability, basic UX, but decent action alignment. The overall benchmark scores allow quantitative comparison between the FSMs to identify strengths and weaknesses. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
