 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided:

FSM 1 (Code 12_1):

State Coverage: 8/10 - Defines states to assess situation, clean room, arrange furniture, unfold rug and monitor woman. Covers major required states but lacks transitions for changing conditions.  

Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Transitions flow sequentially through states but lacks handling for dynamic changes.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 2/10 - Minimal interconnections between states.

Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Seeks to create safe environment but doesn't ensure safety.  

Scalability: 4/10 - Heavily coded for specific scenario, not extendable.

Assistance UX: 5/10 - Focused on environment not occupant needs.  

Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Leverages applicable actions like collecting, sweeping, arranging etc.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.9/10


FSM 2 (Code 12_2):  

State Coverage: 8/10 - Key states cover assessment, hazard clearing, furniture adjustment.

Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Dynamic transitions based on environment checks.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Some interconnections between states.  

Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Proactively clears hazards and monitors environment.   

Scalability: 6/10 - Structured around environment checks but tightly coupled.

Assistance UX: 5/10 - No direct occupant assistance.

Action Set Alignment: 10/10 - Consistently uses actions like grasping, lifting, sliding from standard set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.3/10


FSM 3 (Code 12_3):

State Coverage: 9/10 - Wide coverage of situational states.

Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Branches to states based on environmental factors. 

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Interactions across assessment, action and monitoring states.

Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Explicitly assists occupant navigation and safety.

Scalability: 7/10 - Extensible for additional assistance scenarios.  

Assistance UX: 8/10 - Focused on aiding pregnant occupant.

Action Set Alignment: 5/10 - Uses generic assistance actions rather than standard actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.7/10


FSM 4 (Code 12_4):

State Coverage: 7/10 - Handles key aspects but lacks depth.

Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Linear sequence-based transitions.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Minimal interconnectedness between states.

Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Avoids tripping hazards but doesn't ensure safety. 

Scalability: 5/10 - Tightly coupled to stereotypical navigation scenario.

Assistance UX: 4/10 - Proxy actions without real occupant assistance. 

Action Set Alignment: 2/10 - No usage of the defined action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.7/10

In summary, FSM 3 has the highest overall benchmark score of 7.7/10. It balances state coverage, safety mindset and assistance UX well, although is weaker on strict action set alignment. FSM 2 also scores well on safety and action alignment. FSM 1 and 4 can be improved further across multiple dimensions to handle real-world dynamics.
