 Here is my analysis of the FSMs in the code content:

"3_1"

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers most necessary states like assessing situation, extinguishing flame, preserving tea, placing glasses. Does not have explicit states for verifying success or calling for help.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Decent transitions between states, but lacks fallback transitions if actions fail.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Simple linear transitions between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Prioritizes extinguishing flame which is good, but lacks verification of success.  

5. Scalability: 6/10 - Structure is reasonable but transitions are tightly coupled to specific situations.

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very functional, but no personalization or contextual awareness.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses checking, gripping, squeezing, picking up, placing down, transporting, releasing, monitoring. Decent overlap with benchmark list.


"3_2" 

1. State Coverage: 6/10 - Covers assessing situation, removing candle, calling for help. Lacks states for verifying success.

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Basic transitions, but no fallback paths. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Very linear simple transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Focuses on removing candle hazard.

5. Scalability: 4/10 - Hardcoded transitions make extensions difficult.

6. Assistance UX: 3/10 - Purely functional.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Uses checking, gripping, lifting, transporting, releasing, calling for help from list.


"3_3"

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Has states for assessing, cover/remove candle, extinguish fire. Lacks explicit verification.  

2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Decent transitions, but lacks fallbacks.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10 - Fairly linear transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 8/10 - First priority is to reduce candle danger.  

5. Scalability: 5/10 - Transitions are tightly coupled to scenario.

6. Assistance UX: 4/10 - Informational print statements, but interactions lack empathy/contextual awareness.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Uses reach, grasp, remove, place down, blow for extinguishing along with checking from list.


"3_4" 

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Assesses situation, covers pool, engages children, monitors play, calls for help. No success verification.

2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Decent transitions, but lacks fallbacks.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Mostly linear with some monitoring loops.  

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Prioritizes child safety around pool.

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Encapsulates states/actions making extensions easier.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - Attempts contextual interactions with children.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Uses reaching, gripping, lowering, transporting, reminding, collecting, delivering, calling for help from list.


**Overall Benchmark Scores**

3_1: 6.4/10 

3_2: 5.0/10

3_3: 5.9/10

3_4: 7.0/10
