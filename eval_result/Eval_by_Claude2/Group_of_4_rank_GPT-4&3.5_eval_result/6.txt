 Here is my analysis of the FSMs against the scoring dimensions, using the "6_best" FSM as a benchmark with perfect 10 scores:

FSM 6_1:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers most necessary states like assessing situation, cleaning up mess, storing chemicals safely, monitoring, and calling for help when needed. Does not explicitly handle verifying safety. 

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions between states, but lacks some cleanup handling if chemicals are still unsafely stored after cleaning up mess.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Fairly interconnected states, but could be more complex. 

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Focuses on cleaning up mess and storing chemicals safely. But lacks robust checks before calling initial state done.

5. Scalability: 6 - Structure helps add states, but transitions may get complex with scale.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, but not natural interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses verbs like checking, grasping, mopping largely from standard action set. But also introduces custom cleanup_mess and safestore_chemicals actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

FSM 6_2: 

1. State Coverage: 5 - Covers some basic states but misses many aspects like verifying completion, safety checks, calling for help etc.

2. Transition Coverage: 4 - Transitions seem disjointed, not fully covering likely sequences. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Relatively simple interconnectedness between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 3 - Lacks emphasis on safety states and checks before proceeding.

5. Scalability: 7 - Modular states help extensions, though transitions may get complex.  

6. Assistance UX: 3 - Rigid, robotic indeed.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Introduces many custom non-standard actions like are_products_uncovered(), is_door_open() etc.

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.6 

FSM 6_3:

1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers assessing situation, taking safety precautions, monitoring activity, cleanup, alerts and calling for help.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Robust transitions covering likely sequences of states.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Reasonable interconnectedness, could be slightly more complex.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Clear emphasis on monitoring and addressing safety issues.

5. Scalability: 8 - Structure is conducive for extensions, encapsulates complexity.

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Attempts to provide contextual assistance, though could improve. 

7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Introduces several non-standard custom actions like mop_floor(), clean_shelves() etc.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.4

FSM 6_4:

1. State Coverage: 9 - Assessing situation, cleanup, safety prevention, alerts and calling for help all covered.

2. Transition Coverage: 9 - Comprehensive transitions reflecting likely sequences.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 8 - Reasonable interconnectivity between states. 

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Prioritizes preventing access, cleanup for safety.  

5. Scalability: 7 - Structure is extensible though may get complex with scale.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Attempts natural UX but quite rigid still. 

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Many custom non-standard actions introduced like pickup_spilled_items(), close_door() etc. 

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.9

In summary, FSM 6_3 and 6_4 perform best overall when compared to the benchmark "6_best" FSM. But all of them have room for improvement, especially in incorporating more standardized actions versus too much customization. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
