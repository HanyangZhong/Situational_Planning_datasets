 Here is my analysis of the FSMs:

FSM 1 (20_1):

State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, reaching device, confirming alert and calling for help. No state for continuous monitoring of environment or elderly. 

Transition Coverage: 7 - Has basic transitions between states, but no transitions back to monitoring states.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simple linear transitions between states.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to help by reaching device and calling for help. No continuous monitoring for safety.  

Scalability: 6 - Adds new states easily, but transitions are simplistic.

Assistance UX: 5 - Very basic assistive actions only when alerted. No personalization.

Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses reaching, grasping, lowering, pressing and calling verbs from standard action set.

Overall Score: 6.7

FSM 2 (20_2):

State Coverage: 7 - Covers core states, but no continuous monitoring of environment or elderly.

Transition Coverage: 6 - Basic transitions focused just on device retrieval.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strict linear state machine. 

Safety Mindset: 5 - Helps when alerted but no ongoing safety checks.

Scalability: 7 - Modular states support extensions.

Assistance UX: 4 - Only device retrieval, pressing and calling. No context.

Action Set Alignment: 9 - Leverages reaching, gripping, transporting, pressing and calling.  

Overall Score: 6.0

FSM 3 (20_3):

State Coverage: 8 - Checks distress, retrieves device, provides assistance. No environment monitoring.

Transition Coverage: 7 - Covers key transitions, but monitoring cycles are missing.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Some monitoring transitions, but still linear.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Checks distress and provides assistance.  

Scalability: 7 - States are reusable, but transitions are narrow.

Assistance UX: 6 - Assists with device, but interactions are simple.  

Action Set Alignment: 9 - Uses reaching, gripping, assisting and calling appropriately.

Overall Score: 7.1


FSM 4 (20_4): 

State Coverage: 9 - Assesses situation, reaches device, assists elderly, calls for help. No environment monitoring.

Transition Coverage: 8 - Has transitions for likely sequences of states. 

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Added branches for reachable device check.

Safety Mindset: 8 - Assesses situation, assists elderly, calls for help.

Scalability: 8 - Logical division of states eases extensions.  

Assistance UX: 7 - Assesses need, provides help, calls for assistance.

Action Set Alignment: 10 - Leverages monitoring, checking, calling verbs properly.

Overall Score: 8.0

To summarize, FSM 4 has the highest overall benchmark score of 8.0 due to its state coverage, transitions, scalability, UX and action alignment. FSM 1, 2 and 3 score lower primarily because they lack ongoing monitoring and have simpler transitions focused only on one-time device retrieval. Continuously checking the environment and elderly person is crucial for home assistance safety and quality of service.
