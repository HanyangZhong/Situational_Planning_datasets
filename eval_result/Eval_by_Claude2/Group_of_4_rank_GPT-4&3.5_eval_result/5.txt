 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided:

FSM 1 ("5_1"):

State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers most key states like assessing situation, securing medication, cleaning counter, checking for children. Does not have state for continued monitoring.  

Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Logical transitions between states, but does not cover potential repeat states if situation changes.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Relatively simple with one to two next states per node.

Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Considers safety by checking for children, but does not continually monitor environment.

Scalability: 6/10 - Structure is reasonable but transitions are tailored tightly to exact scenario.

Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very functional, transactional interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Leverages many actions like gripping, lifting, placing down, checking, monitoring. But also introduces some custom verbs like "wiping".

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7/10


FSM 2 ("5_2"):  

State Coverage: 7/10 - Covers assessment, collection, security, clean up. No detailed children safety check.

Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Handles core flow but omits transitions needed to detect all changes. 

Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10 - Simplistic structure with mostly linear transitions.

Safety Mindset: 5/10 - Attempts to secure medication but no further safety steps.

Scalability: 7/10 - Reasonable encapsulation with high potential for extension.

Assistance UX: 4/10 - Very functional and robotic interactions.  

Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Leverages many defined actions like collecting, closing, sweeping. Introduces "transporting".

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7/10


FSM 3 ("5_3"):

State Coverage: 9/10 - Thorough states covering assessment, security, clean up, monitoring.

Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Catches most key transitions for dynamic situation.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Manages complexity decently with possible repeats.

Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Prioritizes safety throughout including environment checks.

Scalability: 8/10 - Structure is extensible to new contexts.

Assistance UX: 7/10 - Attempts to contextualize actions but could improve phrasing.  

Action Set Alignment: 5/10 - Heavily tailored verb set including "scooping", "arranging".  

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.4/10


FSM 4 ("5_4"):

State Coverage: 6/10 - Covers assessment and core actions but lacks monitoring.

Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Linear flow without handling repeat states.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Overly simplistic structure.

Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Tries to address safety by securing medication.

Scalability: 5/10 - Tightly coupled to specifics of this scenario.

Assistance UX: 4/10 - Very functional interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 6/10 - Some alignment with "collecting", "placing" but also introduces "mopping", "wiping".

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3/10
