 Here are my analysis and scores for the FSMs:

Code 4_3:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like identifying danger, removing risks, securing area. No explicit monitoring/idle state.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Logical transitions between states, but lacks transitions once area is secured.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear structure, states execute sequentially.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes safety by addressing risks first. 

5. Scalability: 6 - Structure is extensible, but state names could be more generic.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Functional but very robotic, lacks personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Utilizes some benchmark actions like Turning, Transporting, but also uses many custom actions.

Overall Score: 6


Code 4_4:  

1. State Coverage: 9 - Comprehensive states covering key risk areas. 

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Robust transitions handling various state permutations.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Some interconnectedness between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Very safety-focused transitions.

5. Scalability: 7 - Structure is generic for extendibility, but kitchen-specific.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Attempts contextual interactions, but still rigid.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Leverages some benchmark actions like Turning, Opening, but primarily custom.

Overall Score: 7

In summary, 4_3 takes a more functional approach focusing on risk mediation, while 4_4 aims for comprehensive environmental monitoring. Both score reasonably well, but have room for improvement per the category-specific feedback above, especially Alignment to standard actions. Anchoring to the "perfect 10" benchmark example, there are opportunities to enhance coverage, interconnectivity, scalability, UX, and conformity to assistance best practices.
