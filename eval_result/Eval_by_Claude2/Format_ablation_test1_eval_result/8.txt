 Here are the detailed analyses and scores for the two additional FSMs (8_3 and 8_4) compared to the benchmark 8_best:

**FSM 8_3 Analysis:**

State Coverage: 5/10 - It has 3 defined states to handle the knife hazard scenario which covers some necessary states, but lacks monitoring/continuous checking, final safety checks before completing, calling for help if unable to mitigate hazard, etc.

Transition Coverage: 7/10 - The state transitions cover the key scenarios of detecting the hazard and addressing it. But lacks transitions to handle remaining hazards or get help.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - There are few interconnections between states. It is moderately complex but doesn't account for all likely state changes.

Safety Mindset: 8/10 - The state machine prioritizes safe knife arrangement and checks for other hazards, promoting safety. But lacks final checks before completing.  

Scalability: 4/10 - The state handling is entangled with the helper methods for each action making extensibility challenging.

Assistance UX: 6/10 - The state machine is reasonably contextual with the kitchen hazard scenario, but interactions lack personalization.

Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses relevant actions like Observing, Reaching, Gripping, Rotating, Placing Down. Does not introduce actions outside defined set.

**Overall Benchmark Score:** 6.3/10

**FSM 8_4 Analysis:**  

State Coverage: 7/10 - Defines states to check environment, handle drawer hazard, assist cooking. Covers key states, but lacks transitions for continuous monitoring or getting help.

Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Transitions address the core safety flow. But lacks complexity for unlikely transitions or branching hazard scenarios.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Each state only transitions to one following state, lacking interconnectivity complexity.

Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Clear focus on mitigating drawer hazard before proceeding to assistance demonstrates safety mindset.

Scalability: 8/10 - Helper methods encapsulate complexity making additional hazard handling extendible.  

Assistance UX: 5/10 - Interactions cover basics but lack personalization for quality UX.

Action Set Alignment: 6/10 - Uses some applicable actions like Checking, Closing, Organizing, Installing. But also introduces non-standard actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score:** 6.7/10

In summary, FSM 8_3 scores higher on state transitions and UX while FSM 8_4 prioritizes safety and scalability. But both have limitations compared to the benchmark example. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
