 Sure, I'm happy to provide an analysis and scoring for the FSMs.

For "17_3":

1. State Coverage: 7 - It has states to handle key scenarios like monitoring, reaching child, transporting child, and calling for help. But does not cover securing the environment (e.g. installing safety gate).

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - The state transitions cover likely sequences fairly completely. But additional transitions could be added, like from transporting child back to monitoring if unsafe condition persists.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - There is some interconnectedness between states but it could be more dense. Each state generally only transitions to one following state.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - The primary focus is on securing the child away from the danger area, putting safety at the forefront.

5. Scalability: 6 - Structure is reasonably encapsulated but tying behaviors directly into states limits reusability and extensions somewhat.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Interactions are reasonably natural but lacks personalization and contextual responses.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Most actions are selected from the defined vocabulary, only introducing the custom "gripping" action.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.9

For "17_4":

1. State Coverage: 9 - Contains monitoring, securing child, installing safety mechanisms to cover key scenarios.

2. Transition Coverage: 9 - State transitions are well connected to cover likely sequences. Allows traversing critical path but also back to monitoring.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - There is reasonable interconnectivity between some states but it could be denser.

4. Safety Mindset: 10 - Well covers monitoring risk, transporting child to safety, installing preventative gate.

5. Scalability: 8 - Structure provides good encapsulation and opportunities for extension.

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Interactions would feel reasonably natural but could be further improved.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Strictly adheres to the defined action set vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.7

In summary, "17_4" rates higher on safety mindset, encapsulation, action alignment, and overall coverage of critical states and transitions. But "17_3" has a more simplified structure. Both could continue to improve Assistance UX. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
