 Here are the detailed analysis and scores for the FSMs "13_3" and "13_4":

FSM "13_3"

1. State Coverage: 8 - It covers the key states like detecting hazard, reaching bottles, transporting bottles, placing bottles. Does not handle post-action like ventilation.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Logical transitions between states, but lacks transitions for error handling.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Mostly linear progression of states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Focus on removing hazard, but lacks post-hazard mitigation like checking on pregnant woman.  

5. Scalability: 8 - Structure is extendable to handle more complex environments and tasks.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, could improve the assistance experience.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Uses 7 out of 56 actions like Reaching, Gripping, Lifting, Placing down. Very aligned.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.0

FSM "13_4":

1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers monitoring, removing hazard, transporting to safe zone, securing chemicals.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Accounts for different outcomes at each state.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Some interconnected states but mostly linear.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Transports chemicals to safe location and secures them.

5. Scalability: 7 - Structure allows additional states/transitions to be added.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Functional, could be more human-centric.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses 10 benchmark actions like Reaching, Grasping, Lowering, Closing.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.5

In summary, FSM "13_4" scores slightly higher due to more complete state coverage, better transition handling, safety considerations, and usage of more standard actions. But both score respectably against the benchmark "13_best". The overall structure and alignment to key assistance criteria are solid. As the Quantitative scores show, refinements to improve user experience, interconnectivity, and scalability can tune these FSMs further.
