 Here are the detailed analysis and scores for the FSMs:

FSM 7_3:

1. State Coverage: 8 - It has key states for collecting items, arranging shoes, and checking lamp cord. But lacks explicit assessing hazard and monitoring states.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Reasonably connected transitions between clutter handling states. But lacks transitions for ongoing monitoring.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linear sequencing of states to address clutter makes it simple.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Cleans up tripping hazards but doesn't explicitly recheck safety.

5. Scalability: 6 - Additional states would fit OK, but transitions may get complex.

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very task-focused interactions without personalization.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses relevant actions like reaching, gripping, transporting, lowering, inserting, and removing.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3

FSM 7_4:

1. State Coverage: 7 - Key states of scanning, reaching, and transporting to address hazards. But no explicit initial and final safety checks.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Scanning state transitions to reaching when hazards found, and then to transporting. Closes loop well.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Each state has at most one following state, reasonably simple.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Actively scans and mitigates hazards. But no final safety verification.  

5. Scalability: 8 - Additional states integrate cleanly for new capabilities.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional interactions focused narrowly on hazard removal.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses relevant actions like reaching, gripping, transporting. But omits safety verification actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.0

In summary, FSM 7_3 scores higher on action alignment but lower on UX. FSM 7_4 does better on encapsulation and transitions. Both have key gaps in safety and monitoring. The overall scores reflect their strengths and weaknesses. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
