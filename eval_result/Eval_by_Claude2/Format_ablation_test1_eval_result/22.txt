 Here are the analysis and scores for the FSMs "22_3" and "22_4":

FSM "22_3" analysis:
1. State Coverage: 7 - Covers key states like monitoring, responding and pressing the emergency button. But lacks assessing the woman's condition after alerting for help.
2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Good transitions between states. Could improve connections if emergency button press is unsuccessful.  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Simple state transitions without too much interconnectedness between states.
4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Clear focus on monitoring environment and responding to emergency to ensure safety.
5. Scalability: 6 - Structure is modular but has some custom methods tightly coupled to current behavior.
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Interactions cover necessities but has room for more natural, contextual conversations.  
7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses relevant actions like monitoring, responding, reaching, pressing. But also introduces some custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4

FSM "22_4" analysis:  
1. State Coverage: 8 - Has key states to check environment, reach and press emergency button. Lacks follow-up care after alerting.   
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Goes through necessary states but misses unlikely transitions.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Fair degree of interconnectedness through incrementing rounds counter.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Captures safety mindset in states like calling for help. Gaps in proactive care after alert.
5. Scalability: 7 - Structure with encapsulated states is fairly extensible.  
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Handles situation systematically but very robotically.
7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Leverages predefined action vocabulary well, introducing only one custom print method.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 7 

In summary, both FSMs cover the key emergency response states and actions decently to merit above average overall scores. But "22_3" edges out with better encapsulation and transition coverage structure, while "22_4" aligns more strictly to the standardized action vocabulary. Both still have room for improvement to match the ideal "22_best" FSM across assessed dimensions like scalability, assistance UX quality, safety emphasis and integration of required states.
