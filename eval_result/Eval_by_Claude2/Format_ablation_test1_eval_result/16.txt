 Here are the scoring and analysis for the FSMs "16_3" and "16_4":

FSM 16_3:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Has key states of monitoring and preventing danger, but missing explicit state checking if danger was successfully prevented before going back to monitoring.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Transitions cover the basic flow, but lacks transitions for when preventing danger fails or other boundary cases.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Core flow has only 2 main states resulting in lower complexity.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Primary goal is safety by preventing and addressing danger. But lacks handling for all cases.

5. Scalability: 7 - Structure is mostly modular, additional states could be added, but some entanglement with helper methods.  

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, but no contextualization or personalization for child.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Defines custom actions not aligning with standard vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3


FSM 16_4:  

1. State Coverage: 9 - Contains monitoring, removing danger, and serving child states covering necessary scenarios.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Handles core sequences, but lacks explicit transitions for some boundary cases.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Has 4 main states with interconnected transitions resulting in moderately complex structure.  

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Primary objective is safety by removing dangers. Reminds child as well.

5. Scalability: 8 - Mostly modular composition, additional states and transitions can extend functionality.

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Serves child's needs, but still quite functionally focused.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 2 - Defines custom actions rather than leveraging standard action vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.1

In summary, FSM 16_3 is simpler with only 2 core states, while FSM 16_4 has greater coverage of necessary states and transitions, resulting in moderately higher complexity, safety, and scalability at the cost of lower action alignment. But both score low on leveraging the standard action vocabulary. The overall scores reflect these tradeoffs. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
