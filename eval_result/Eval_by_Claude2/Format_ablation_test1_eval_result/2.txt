 Here are the detailed analyses with scores on the 7 dimensions for the FSMs in code 2_3 and 2_4:

Code 2_3 Analysis:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers the key states of identifying the mess, cleaning it up, and tidying the kitchen. Does not include explicit safety/monitoring states.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Connects the main states, but no fallbacks if certain states fail.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simple linear transitions between a limited set of states.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Cleans up hazard, but no explicit mechanism for continuous monitoring.

5. Scalability: 7 - Modular state methods enable extending to new contexts.

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very functional, not personalized or contextual interactions.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Most encoded actions are from the benchmark list, with some custom actions like mopping_floor().

Overall Score: 6.4


Code 2_4 Analysis:  

1. State Coverage: 9 - Detecting, cleaning, resetting, and monitoring are key states. No initial or final check states.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Handles all key transitions, along with fallbacks to monitoring.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Some interconnections between states, but overall quite simple transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Explicit monitoring state and spill detection transitions.

5. Scalability: 8 - Encapsulates states nicely, would be easy to extend new states.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Communicates state transitions, but very robotic.

7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Strictly uses high-level actions like detect_spill(), clean_spill() from benchmark list.

Overall Score: 8.1

In summary, code 2_4 has higher coverage of key states and transitions, better safety mechanisms, and stricter action alignment, leading to a higher overall benchmark score. Both FSMs could be improved by enhancing contexts and UX. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
