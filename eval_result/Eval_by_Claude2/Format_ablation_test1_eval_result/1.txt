 Here are the detailed analysis and scores for the FSMs:

**FSM 1_3 Analysis:**

1. State Coverage: 5 - Has states for main actions like mopping floor, wiping mirror etc. But does not cover important states like checking shower, spill detection, monitoring etc.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Transitions back to checking state after each action. But no mechanism to transition out of repeating loop.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Main checking state transitions to multiple action states in loop. But overall complexity is medium.  

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes mopping wet floor over other actions. But lacks ongoing monitoring.

5. Scalability: 8 - Structure is extendable by adding states as needed. But state connections are not parameterized.  

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Performs actions without personalization or context. Interactions are functional but robotic.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses relevant action verbs like mopping, wiping, arranging, hanging. But also introduces "checking" which is not in the benchmark list.

**FSM 1_3 Overall Benchmark Score:** 6.4

**FSM 1_4 Analysis:** 

1. State Coverage: 8 - Checks major environment factors. But does not cover shower checking, spill detection etc.

2. Transition Coverage: 9 - Fully connects states with contextual transitions.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Overall complexity is medium. More states can make interconnectivity dense.  

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Prioritizes cleaning slippery floor first. Ongoing checks promote safety.

5. Scalability: 7 - Structure is extendable but increased states complicate transitions.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Lacks personalization and context in interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Uses verbs like reaching, gripping, lifting, hanging strictly from benchmark list.

**FSM 1_4 Overall Benchmark Score:** 8

In summary, FSM 1_3 has medium complexity and safety approach, but lacks coverage and personalization. FSM 1_4 prioritizes safety with good alignment to action benchmark, but needs more coverage and interaction context. Considering all factors, FSM 1_4 performs better with overall score of 8 out of 10.
