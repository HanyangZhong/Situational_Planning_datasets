 Here are the scores and analysis for the FSMs in code "6_3" and "6_4" compared to code "6_best":

Code "6_3" scores:

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - It has scanning, collecting, arranging, closing, and checking states which cover key aspects, but does not verify safety after closing containers.  

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - The transitions connect the key states, but does not cover continuing to monitor after securing the area.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - There are sequential transitions from scanning to checking which minimize complexity, but no clear way to handle exceptions.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - It tries to arrange and contain hazards, but does not verify area safety.

5. Scalability: 6/10 - Adding states is straightforward, but handling new contexts would require changes in each state's functionality.  

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very robotic focused on tasks rather than assistive interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses collecting, arranging, closing, checking verbs from standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7/10


Code "6_4" scores:  

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Has basic, cleaning and safeguarding states covering key aspects, but no detailed safety verification.

2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Transitions connect the core states, but no external monitoring if hazards remain. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 8/10 - Simple cyclic transitions between 3 states minimizes complexity.

4. Safety Mindset: 5/10 - Focuses more on cleaning than hazard prevention.

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Additional states integrate cleanly, but would require changing state functionality.  

6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - States align with assistive goals, but interactions are not personalized.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Uses verbs like cleaning, safeguarding aligned with standard actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4/10

In summary, code "6_3" better covers necessary states and transitions, as well as strictly aligning with standard action vocabulary. But code "6_4" has lower cyclomatic complexity. Both score higher on scalability and action alignment, but lag on safety mindset and human-centric UX. Adding safety verification and external monitoring would improve coverage.
