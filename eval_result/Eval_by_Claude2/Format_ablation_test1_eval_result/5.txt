 Here are the detailed scores and analysis for the FSMs:

FSM 5_3:

1. State Coverage: 8 - It has states to Check, Collect, Secure and Clean which cover the key aspects. Lacks a monitoring state once done.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Transitions connect the main states, but no fallback transitions.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear with each state having 1 following state.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Securing medications and cleaning spills helps safety. But no active monitoring.  

5. Scalability: 6 - Structure helps add states, but no abstraction of common actions.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, not personalized or contextual interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses Collecting, Checking, Placing which align well. But also custom actions like Secure vs Folding.

Overall Score: 6.7

FSM 5_4:  

1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers gathering pills, closing bottles, closing cabinet and monitoring. Just misses mopping spills.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Connects key states, has a fallback transition to start state if unsafe.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Multiple next states possible from Monitoring state making it moderately interconnected.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Monitoring state specifically checks and addresses safety. Closing bottles/cabinet helps.

5. Scalability: 7 - Breaks actions into helper methods, but high coupling may hinder extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Structured but not personalized. Could be more natural.

7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Aligns very tightly using Reaching, Grasping, Closing, Collecting, Monitoring etc.

Overall Score: 8.0

In summary, FSM 5_4 aligns better to the benchmark across most dimensions like Safety and Action Alignment. But 5_3 has slightly better State Coverage. Both could be improved by adding more transitions, abstraction and UX polish.
