 Here are the detailed scoring and analysis for the FSMs "10_3" and "10_4":

FSM 10_3:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states of identifying obstacle, removing it and assisting human. A state to continue monitoring after assistance could be added.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Reasonably complete transitions between states. A transition back to monitoring after assistance could be added.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Has 3 main states with linear transitions. Not overly complex.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to fully remove obstacle before assisting human. But lacks fallback handling.

5. Scalability: 6 - States are reasonably encapsulated, but transitions lack flexibility.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Functional, but interactions lack personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses 12 actions from defined set. Custom actions like "reminding" introduced.


FSM 10_4:

1. State Coverage: 9 - Key states covered including idle, evaluation, clearing path and assistance.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Has transitions covering likely state sequences.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Simple linear state transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to clear path before assist. But lacks redundancy.

5. Scalability: 7 - Modular states aid extensions, but transitions less flexible.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Clear that it assists the user, but interactions lack warmth.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Uses 13 defined actions. Minimal custom verbs introduced.


Overall Benchmark Scores:

FSM 10_3: 6.4

FSM 10_4: 7.3

In summary, both FSMs cover the key states and have reasonable transition logic. 10_4 scores slightly higher for having idle and evaluation states, more scalability, and aligning closer to the standard action vocabulary. But both lack sophistication in interaction design and fallback handling. The overall scores indicate there is room for improvement to reach the capabilities of the 10_best benchmark example.
