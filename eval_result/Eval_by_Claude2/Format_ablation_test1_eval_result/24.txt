 Here are my analysis and scores for the FSMs:

"24_3" FSM:

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - It has key states for monitoring, reaching, and removing toys. But lacks states for engaging child or calling for help.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Covers core sequences, but lacks transitions for errors or alternate branches.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Simple linear transitions between a few states.

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Strong focus on monitoring and removing choking hazards.  

5. Scalability: 6/10 - Additional states would fit, but transitions may get complex.

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very functional, but no personalization or context awareness.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses 'monitoring', 'reaching', 'grasping' from standard action set.

Overall Score: 7.0/10


"24_4" FSM:

1. State Coverage: 6/10 - Has monitoring and removal but lacks breadth.

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Handles main flow but omits branches.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Very simple transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Removes hazards but narrow focus.

5. Scalability: 4/10 - Hard to extend without restructuring.

6. Assistance UX: 3/10 - Purely functional, no humanization.   

7. Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Leverages 'monitoring', 'gripping', 'releasing'.

Overall Score: 5.0/10

In summary, the "24_3" FSM has reasonably broad state coverage focused on safety, but interactions are not humanized. The "24_4" FSM directly removes hazards but is structurally limited in expandability and user experience. Both score positively on incorporating standard actions but fall short of the well-rounded "24_best" benchmark example. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
