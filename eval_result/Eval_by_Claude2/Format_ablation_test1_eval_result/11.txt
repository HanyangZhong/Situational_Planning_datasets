 Here are the scoring and analysis for the FSMs provided:

Code 11_3 FSM:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Has most necessary states like Checking_Conditions, Reaching_Medicine, Delivering_Medicine. Does not have explicit states for calling for help if needed.  

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Has direct transitions between adjacent states, but no fallback transitions if an action fails.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linear state transitions without much interconnectivity between non-adjacent states.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - No explicit safety checks before physical actions.

5. Scalability: 7 - Reasonably encapsulated but may need some refactoring for extensibility.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Functional but not personalized or context-aware interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses Reaching, Delivering, Checking, Monitoring actions from standard set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

Strengths: 
- Covers core functionality for medicine delivery task.
- Simple linear state transitions.

Weaknesses: 
- Lacks safety checks and error handling.
- No call for assistance capability.
- Rigid interactions.


Code 11_4 FSM: 

1. State Coverage: 7 - Checks patient condition and delivers medicine, but no explicit resting state.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Has transitions to handle multiple scenarios. Falls short of being fully connected.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Some interconnections between non-linear states.

4. Safety Mindset: 5 - No safety checks before physical actions.

5. Scalability: 8 - Reasonably encapsulated in states for easy extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Functional interactions only, no personalization.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses Checking, Monitoring, Delivering actions from standard vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

Strengths:
- Flexible transitions to handle multiple scenarios. 
- Encapsulates key functionality into reusable states.

Weaknesses:
- No safety checks or error handling.  
- No explicit call for assistance capability.
- Lacks personalization.
