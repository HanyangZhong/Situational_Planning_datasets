 Here are the detailed analysis and scores for the FSMs "3_3" and "3_4":

FSM "3_3"

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like scanning room, reaching candle, transporting candle. Does not have a state for verifying candle extinguished.  

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Logical transitions between states, but lacks transitions back to scanning room state from some action states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linear state transitions without much interconnectivity between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes moving candle when detected too close to books. But lacks mechanisms to verify safety.  

5. Scalability: 8 - Encapsulates states well, new states can be added for new capabilities.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, but no customization or human-centric interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Uses only allowed actions like reaching, gripping, transporting.

Overall Score: 7.3

FSM "3_4" 

1. State Coverage: 7 - Has monitor room, reach candle, transport candle states. Lacks verifying candle put out safely.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Good transitions between key states, returns to monitoring.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Linear state transitions without much interconnectivity. 

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Transports candle but lacks safety verification mechanisms.

5. Scalability: 7 - Decent encapsulation but transitions are not very extendable.  

6. Assistance UX: 4 - No human-centric interactions or personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Uses allowed actions like reaching, transporting.  

Overall Score: 6.7

In summary, FSM "3_3" has slightly better coverage of necessary states and transitions, with a more encapsulated design. But FSM "3_4" also handles the core workflow. Both lack strong safety verifications and human-centric interactions. Their strict use of the allowed action vocabulary results in a maximum score for that dimension. The overall scores come to 7.3 and 6.7 out of 10 respectively.
