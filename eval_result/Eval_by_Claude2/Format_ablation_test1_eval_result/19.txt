 Here are my analysis and scores for the FSMs:

FSM 19_3:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers the key states of monitoring, protecting and alerting. Does not explicitly handle securing the stove area.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Covers likely state transitions, but lacks transitions back to monitoring if states like protecting fail.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simple linear transitions between a limited set of states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes moving child to safety. Does not cover securing stove. 

5. Scalability: 8 - Additional states and transitions can be added modularly.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, but no personalization or context handling.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses some defined actions like Monitoring, Reaching and Responding, but also uses unspecified custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3


FSM 19_4: 

1. State Coverage: 6 - Covers key states of monitoring, reaching and removing. Lacks transitions for calling help.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Has transitions from reaching to removing, but lacks fail cases.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very simple linear state transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Focuses on child and pot safety. No help calling.

5. Scalability: 7 - Additional states can be inserted modularly.  

6. Assistance UX: 3 - Purely functional. No personalization or context awareness.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 2 - Relies heavily on custom unspecified actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.7

In summary, FSM 19_3 has moderately strong coverage of key states and transitions, prioritizes safety, is reasonably scalable, but lacks in personalization and action alignment. 

FSM 19_4 is simpler but has gaps in state coverage, safety handling, and action alignment. It also scores low on UX.

Compared to the benchmark example 19_best, both these FSMs have significant scope for improvement across multiple dimensions to reach that gold standard.
