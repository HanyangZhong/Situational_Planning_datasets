 Here is my analysis of the FSMs in code 14_3 and 14_4 compared to the benchmark 14_best:

Code 14_3:

State Coverage: 8/10 - Defines key states of monitoring and removing hazards, but lacks detail on interacting with cat or escalation steps.

Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Covers transitions from monitoring to removing and calling for help, but light on transitions back to monitoring.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Simple linear structure from monitoring to removing.

Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Focuses on removing hazards, but lacks proactive safety steps.

Scalability: 6/10 - Additional states would fit reasonably well, but transitions are not encapsulated.

Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very functional, but no personalization or contextual awareness.

Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses grasping, collecting, and calling for help verbs from standard action set.

Overall Score: 6.4/10


Code 14_4:

State Coverage: 9/10 - Scanning to transporting covers key states, only missing escalation.  

Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Loops back from placing to scanning, but no help transitions.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Linear flow with each state having one following state.

Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Proactively removes hazards.  

Scalability: 7/10 - Additional states would not be too disruptive.

Assistance UX: 6/10 - Still fairly robotic interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 10/10 - Leverages reaching, gripping, transporting, placing from action verbs.

Overall Score: 8/10


In summary, 14_4 scores higher overall by more thoroughly covering key states and transitions for this scenario, using standard action verbs, and maintaining better encapsulation for extensions. 14_3 is simpler but lacks detail in areas like interacting with the cat. Both could be improved by increasing assistance personalization.
