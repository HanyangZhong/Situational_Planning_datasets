 Here are the analyses for the FSMs in code "18_3" and "18_4":

Code "18_3"

1. State Coverage: 8 - It has 4 main states (monitoring child, approaching child, moving away, idle) which seem necessary and sufficient to handle the scene. Though no explicit state for getting help.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Reasonably good transitions between the states, but possibility of getting stuck in some states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - There is some interconnectivity between states, but could be more dense. 

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Key focus is on child's safety and preventing harm.

5. Scalability: 6 - Structure is decent but quite entangled with child safety specifics, could be difficult to extend.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Somewhat robotic interactions, not very natural.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses some non-standard actions like "reaching_child()" etc outside defined vocabulary.

Overall Score: 6.3


Code "18_4"

1. State Coverage: 9 - Contains key states of monitoring, protecting child and covering outlet.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Good transitions, minor possibility of getting stuck in protecting child. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Reasonably interconnected between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 10 - Clear focus on both child safety and removing hazard.

5. Scalability: 8 - Structure seems fairly extensible to other contexts.  

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Decent but lacks personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses helper methods outside defined action vocabulary.

Overall Score: 7

In summary, code "18_3" scores lower on safety mindset, scalability and action alignment. Code "18_4" does better on safety, transitions and extensibility but lacks on UX and action alignment. On the whole, "18_4" matches closer to the "18_best" benchmark example provided.
