 Here are the detailed benchmark scores and analysis for the FSMs in code "12_3" and "12_4":

Code "12_3" FSM:

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - It has relevant states to handle the key elements of the scene like monitoring, collecting hazards, fixing the rug and tidying up. But lacks sophistication to handle more complex scenarios.

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10 - The transitions cover some logical progressions between states, but lacks flexibility. For example, no way to transition back to collecting hazards if new ones appear after tidying up.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Very simple interconnectivity between states. Lacks flexibility to handle variations or interruptions.

4. Safety Mindset: 6/10 - Attempts to address safety by clearing hazards, but no mechanisms to ensure ongoing safety.

5. Scalability: 4/10 - Hardcoded states make it difficult to extend functionality for new contexts.

6. Assistance UX: 2/10 - No states focused on assisting the occupant directly or personalized interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses relevant actions like collecting, arranging, fixing from defined set. Only introduces one new action - "check_hazards".

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.0/10


Code "12_4" FSM:  

1. State Coverage: 9/10 - Covers all key environment checking, issue identification and resolution states. Sophisticated.

2. Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Fully connected states with returns to checking environment. Handles variations.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Some interconnectedness between states, but quite linear.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Proactively addresses safety, but still gaps in ensuring ongoing security.  

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Encapsulates environment checking separately, easing extensions. But issue resolution states are entangled.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - Attempts to personalize by enhancing visibility, comfort. But limited occupant interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Leverages vocabulary well for core environment sensing and resolution behaviors. Only introduces "opening curtains".

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.3/10

In summary, code "12_4" FSM is more sophisticated and robust compared to "12_3", with key strengths in state coverage, transitions, scalability and action alignment. But opportunities remain to enhance complexity, safety mindset and assistance UX.
