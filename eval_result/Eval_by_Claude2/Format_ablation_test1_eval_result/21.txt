 Here are the detailed analysis and scores for the FSMs "21_3" and "21_4":

FSM 21_3 Analysis:
State Coverage: 8 - It covers key states like monitoring, reaching, lifting, transporting and checking. Does not have explicit states for calling emergency services.

Transition Coverage: 7 - Has well connected states to cover main scenarios. Lacks transitions for additional help if needed.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simple linear flow from monitoring to checking. Not densely interconnected.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Focused on safely transporting person closer to button. Lacks safety considerations during lifting motion.

Scalability: 8 - Encapsulates states nicely. Additional states can be added easily.

Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional flow helping user. Can improve on contextual interactions.  

Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses custom verbs like reaching, lifting instead of standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 21_3 = 6.3

FSM 21_4 Analysis:  

State Coverage: 9 - Covers monitoring, alerting, assisting and help arrival. Minor gap is assessing injuries.

Transition Coverage: 8 - Handles transitions well including external help arrival. Could improve on assessing person's condition before assisting.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Goes from monitoring to assisting, relatively linear.

Safety Mindset: 8 - Alerts emergency, provides comfort ensuring safety.

Scalability: 7 - Decent encapsulation, can extend states. Some helper methods do more than one thing.

Assistance UX: 6 - Functional assistance flow, can be more natural.

Action Set Alignment: 4 - Some use of defined actions like ProvideComfort but also uses custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 21_4 = 7.0

In summary, 21_3 has better state coverage but 21_4 handles safety and transitions better with alert button and external help. Both can improve UX and using standard action vocabulary.
