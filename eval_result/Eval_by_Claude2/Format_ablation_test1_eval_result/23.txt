 Here are my analysis and scores for the FSMs:

FSM 23_3:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Defines key states of monitoring, responding and calling for help. Does not explicitly cover assessment.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Covers likely sequences of playing getting rough, responding, persisting rough play, and calling for help. Does not cover transitions back to monitoring after calls for help.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Three main states with linear transitions between them.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes calling for help when monitoring and initial response fails.

5. Scalability: 6 - Additional states and transitions can be added, but current states are loosely coupled.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional transitions, not much personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Utilizes calling for help, monitoring and responding at a high level. Does not leverage a majority of the defined action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0

FSM 23_4:

1. State Coverage: 7 - Defines states to monitor, calm dog and engage child. Does not explicitly call for help. 

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Covers monitoring, calming dog when risk increases, engaging child once dog is calmed.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Simple linear transitions between three states.

4. Safety Mindset: 5 - Seeks to reduce risk, but no fallback if risk persists.

5. Scalability: 7 - Additional states can augment existing structure.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Responds to child and dog, but interactions are functionally driven.

7. Action Set Alignment: 2 - Refers to high-level actions like engaging and calming, does not detail specific capabilities.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.4

In summary, the FSM in 23_3 better covers key states and transitions, prioritizes safety through calling for help, and scores higher in aligning to the standard action set. The FSM in 23_4 directly handles calming the dog and engaging the child, but lacks transitions to call for help if threats persist. Both score moderately overall, with room for improvement to match the structure and capabilities showcased in the 23_best example.
