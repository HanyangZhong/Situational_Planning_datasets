 Here are the detailed benchmark scores and analysis for the FSMs:

Code 20_3:

1. State Coverage: 8 - It covers the key states of checking, reaching, grasping, transporting, serving the device, and calling for help. But does not have explicit states for arrival of help.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - The transitions connect the key states fairly well in likely sequences. But no transitions once help arrives.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Has a linear sequence of directly connected states with no branching.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - It focuses on safely transporting and serving the device. But safety could improve with more monitoring.

5. Scalability: 6 - Adding new states is straightforward. But some entanglement with helper methods.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very robotic without personalization. But serves device safely.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses high level actions like reaching, grasping, transporting, serving device, and calling for help. But does not decompose into full action vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.9

Code 20_4:

1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers key states of monitoring, fetching device, calling for help. Lacks explicit state for arrival of help.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Connects states in likely sequences. But no transitions once help arrives.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Largely linear sequence without branching complexity.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Continuously monitors the situation. Fetches device safely.

5. Scalability: 7 - Additional states can extend functionality. Some helper method entanglement. 

6. Assistance UX: 6 - No personalization but serves device and calls for help.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses high-level actions without full decomposition into standard vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

Summary:

Code 20_3 has a simpler linear structure but gaps in safety monitoring and help response. Code 20_4 does better on safety and transitions, but both lack complex state interconnectivity and alignment to the full action vocabulary. The overall benchmark scores come to 5.9 and 6.7 respectively, compared to the reference score of 10 for code 20_best. This analysis precisely identifies areas for improvement towards more assistive, safe and scalable FSMs for home assistance robots.
