 Here are the detailed analyses of the FSMs:

**Code 15_3 Analysis:**

State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states for the scenario like monitoring, covering outlet, moving plant and collecting toy. Does not include states for things like calming pet if scared.   

Transition Coverage: 7 - Main states are connected, but no branches for special cases like pet getting scared.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly simple chain of states with single transition option from each state.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Makes progress on addressing hazards, but no contingent handling if pet gets distressed.  

Scalability: 8 - Encapsulates states nicely, additional states and transitions can plug in.

Assistance UX: 5 - Very robotic, state-based. No personalization or context awareness.  

Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses action verbs like Covering, Moving, Collecting that align well with standard action set.

**Overall Score: 7**

**Code 15_4 Analysis**:  

State Coverage: 8 - Key states for observing, reaching, collecting. Does not cover contingencies.

Transition Coverage: 5 - Transitions between main states, but gaps in handling all likely scenarios.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Some interconnections between states, but quite linear.

Safety Mindset: 6 - Can detect some risks, but safety is not comprehensive focus.   

Scalability: 7 - States encapsulate functionality, but transitions get complex fast.

Assistance UX: 4 - No customization or context awareness to interaction.

Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages verbs like Observing, Reaching, Collecting from standard action set.

**Overall Score: 6.3**

In summary, both FSMs cover some key states and functionality for the scenario, but are quite simple, robotic, and lack handling for contingencies and safety issues. Code 15_3 is slightly stronger. Both would benefit from greater interconnectivity between states, more complete coverage of likely scenarios, and integrating a safety-focused perspective. Their strength is modularity that supports future evolution.
