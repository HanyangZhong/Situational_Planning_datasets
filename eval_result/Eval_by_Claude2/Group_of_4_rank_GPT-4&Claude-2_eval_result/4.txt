 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided:

FSM 4_1:
State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, removing hazards, and ventilating. No state for verifying hazard removal or calling for help if needed.  
Transition Coverage: 7 - Logical transitions between states, but no fallback if hazard persists.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear with each state having 1-2 transition options.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Proactively removes hazards and checks for dangers. No verification of safety.   
Scalability: 6 - Specific to kitchen scene, but relatively encapsulated. Additions would require changes.
Assistance UX: 5 - Functional Assistance UX, Assesses hazards and warns human helper. But interactions lack personalization.
Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses 1 benchmark action (Monitoring) supplemented by custom actions suited to scenario like Removing hazards.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0

FSM 4_2: 
State Coverage: 9 - Thorough states like assessing, removing hazards, checking aftermath. No calling for outside help.
Transition Coverage: 8 - Closed loop transitions assessing after actions. No transitions for help if risk persists  
Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Mostly linear with branches to handle multiple risks 
Safety Mindset: 8 - Focused on identifying and reducing risks
Scalability: 7 - Structure enables extensions but requires internal changes  
Assistance UX: 6 - Checks safety for human, but interactions lack personal touch  
Action Set Alignment: 5 - Leverages 5 benchmark actions (Checking, Monitoring, Reaching, Turning, Opening) plus customized actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.0  

FSM 4_3:
State Coverage: 7 - Has assessment and mitigation but gaps in sustained monitoring or calling for assistance.
Transition Coverage: 6 - Can get trapped in monitor state if unable to mitigate hazard.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Largely linear progression through states.  
Safety Mindset: 7 - Seeks to identify and mitigate hazards. No external assistance called.
Scalability: 5 - Structure is rigid to modification with hand-coded responses.
Assistance UX: 3 - Minimal, automated interactions with no personalization.  
Action Set Alignment: 1 - Predominantly custom actions like Hazard Mitigation, with no alignment to benchmark.

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.7

FSM 4_4:
State Coverage: 8 - Assesses and mitigates kitchen fire risks. No cleanup or help states.   
Transition Coverage: 7 - Monitor state lacks transitions if hazard returns.  
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Largely linear progression through states.
Safety Mindset: 9 - Laser focused on fire prevention and mitigation.  
Scalability: 4 - Highly specialized with no encapsulation for extensions.
Assistance UX: 3 - Automated hazard notifications rather than assistive interactions.
Action Set Alignment: 2 - Uses 2 benchmark actions (Checking, Calling) among other custom actions tailored to fire prevention.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3

In summary, FSM 4_2 has the highest overall benchmark score of 7.0 owing to its combination of risk assessment, mitigation actions tuned to the scenario, and closed-loop checking. FSM 4_1 also scores well by covering key states and transitions for the situation. FSMs 4_3 and 4_4 are more rigid and specialized implementations with lower scores.
