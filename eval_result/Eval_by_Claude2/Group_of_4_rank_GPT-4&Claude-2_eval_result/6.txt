 Here are my analysis and scores for the FSMs:

FSM 6_1:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers most necessary states like assessing situation, cleaning up mess, storing chemicals, monitoring, and calling for help. Does not have separate states for detecting issues and verifying fixes.  

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions between states, but lacks some connections like going from clean up to call for help if chemicals still unsafe.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear progression of states without too much interconnectivity.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Focuses on cleaning up and storing chemicals, but lacks transitions to handle lingering safety issues.  

5. Scalability: 6 - Structure is reasonable but transitions may get complex if more states/scenarios added.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, but no personalization or context awareness.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses inventory verbs like grasping, lifting, placing down. Minimal custom actions.


Overall Benchmark Score: 6.9


FSM 6_2:

1. State Coverage: 5 - Covers basics like checking room, cleaning up, closing door. Missing key states for verifying fixes.

2. Transition Coverage: 4 - Transitions are linear without flexibility to handle contingencies. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strict linear progression of states.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Attempts to secure products and clean spills.

5. Scalability: 7 - Simple structure could extend well to more scenarios.  

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very rigid and non-personalized.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Closely sticks to standard action verbs.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.6


FSM 6_3: 

1. State Coverage: 7 - Assesses, secures room, cleans spills, and monitors afterwards. No separate verification.

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Decent transitions, but lacks nuance for lingering issues.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Mostly linear with some flexibility to toggle between assess and monitor.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Prioritizes securing chemicals and cleaning spills first.  

5. Scalability: 5 - Structure may get complex if more layers of states added.

6. Assistance UX: 3 - Purely functional, no personalization.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses standard actions like collecting, placing, wiping. Some custom methods.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0


FSM 6_4:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Assesses, secures room, cleans spills, checks supplies. No separate verification.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Can toggle between assess and check supplies, but transitions lack nuance.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Mostly linear progression of states. 

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes securing room and removing immediate hazards.

5. Scalability: 8 - Encapsulates states well for easier extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 3 - Functional, but no personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Closely adheres to standard action verb vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3
