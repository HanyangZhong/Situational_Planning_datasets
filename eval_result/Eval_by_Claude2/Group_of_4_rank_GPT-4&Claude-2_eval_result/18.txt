 Here are my scores and analysis for the additional FSMs provided:

FSM 1 ("18_1"):

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers major states, but misses nuances like ensuring child safety after interventions.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Handles key scenarios, but lacks backup transitions if main sequences fail.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Sufficient to cover basic scenarios, but additional states could interconnect more.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Makes safety a priority, but doesn't guarantee preventing harm.  

5. Scalability: 8 - Encapsulates complexity well within states to allow extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Functional assistance, but interactions could be more natural.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Generally aligns with standard action vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.0

FSM 2 ("18_2"):

1. State Coverage: 7 - Key states covered, but lacks nuanced safety checks.  

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Handles primary scenarios, but backup transitions limited.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - balanced interconnectivity between states.  

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - proactively addresses safety, but still potential gaps.

5. Scalability: 7 - Some entanglement across states, may resist modification.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very function-driven interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Closely aligns with the defined action vocabulary.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.9

FSM 3 ("18_3"):

1. State Coverage: 6 - Misses some key states like ensuring safety.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Handles some sequences but has major gaps.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Leans more linear in structure.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes safety, but limits to hazard removal.

5. Scalability: 6 - Some modularity but key dependencies across states.  

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, robotic in nature.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Generally sticks to standard actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.9

FSM 4 ("18_4"):

1. State Coverage: 5 - Broad strokes, major gaps in coverage.

2. Transition Coverage: 4 - Linear flow, misses scenarios.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strictly linear structure. 

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Goal of safety, but approach has gaps.  

5. Scalability: 5 - Module boundaries, but high coupling across.

6. Assistance UX: 4 - blueprint quality interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Attempts vocabulary alignment.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.9

To summarize, FSM 1 has the highest overall benchmark score due to reasonably strong coverage, safety, scalability and action alignment. But there are still opportunities to enhance connectivity, interactions, and complexity for greater context handling. FSM 2 also scores well on safety but has some limitations around transitions and UX. FSM 3 and 4 have significant gaps in coverage, transitions, complexity and UX indicating lower capability to robustly assist across scenarios. Let me know if you have any other questions!
