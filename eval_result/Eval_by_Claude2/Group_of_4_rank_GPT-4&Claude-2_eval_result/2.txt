 Here are my analysis and scores for the FSMs in code content "2_1", "2_2", "2_3", and "2_4" compared to the benchmark "2_best":

2_1 Analysis:
- State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like recognizing hazard, cleaning up, monitoring. Does not explicitly secure environment or call for help.
- Transition Coverage: 7 - Main paths are covered but lacks transitions from stove on to spill states.
- Complexity: 5 - Medium interconnectivity between states.
- Safety Mindset: 7 - Focuses on hazard mitigation though no warnings.  
- Scalability: 8 - Fairly modular structure enabling extensions.
- UX: 5 - Somewhat robotic flow between states.
- Action Alignment: 8 - Leverages checking, grabbing, mopping, placing, turning from benchmark list.

2_1 Overall Benchmark Score: 7.0

2_2 Analysis: 
- State Coverage: 7 - Key states of assessing, handling and cleaning spill. No warnings or monitoring.
- Transition Coverage: 5 - Handles spill transitions but no complexity beyond that.
- Complexity: 3 - Very linear basic transitions between states.
- Safety Mindset: 5 - Mitigates spill but no other cautions.
- Scalability: 7 - Structure allows additional states if needed.
- UX: 5 - Simple imperative style flow.
- Action Alignment: 7 - Uses detecting, gripping, lifting, reaching, placing, mopping from list.

2_2 Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7

2_3 Analysis:
- State Coverage: 8 - Assesses, blocks, cleans and checks. No explicit initial state.
- Transition Coverage: 7 - Covers key paths, doesn't loop back from check.
- Complexity: 5 - Linear flow, no branching logic.
- Safety Mindset: 7 - Blocks kitchen access.
- Scalability: 8 - Adds well to existing structure.
- UX: 5 - Printed imperative flow.
- Action Alignment: 6 - Leverages sensing, placing, wiping indirectly.

2_3 Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

2_4 Analysis:  
- State Coverage: 8 - Assesses, blocks access, cleans and checks afterwards.
- Transition Coverage: 7 - Main transitions covered, no loops back from check.
- Complexity: 4 - Strict linear state transitions.
- Safety Mindset: 7 - Barriers and checking for ongoing hazards.
- Scalability: 8 - Structure allows additional states easily.
- UX: 5 - Printed state changes, not very fluid.
- Action Alignment: 6 - detect, place, mop used from list.

2_4 Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3

In summary, the additional FSMs have some strengths in modular structure and readability but generally score lower than the benchmark across dimensions like state coverage, complexity, safety approach, and user experience. Their overall scores range from 5.7 to 6.7 out of 10 compared to a perfect score of 10 for the benchmark. This indicates there is significant room for improvement to match the robustness and fluency of the benchmark FSM. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
