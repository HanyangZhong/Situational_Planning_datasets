 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs by scoring them across the 7 dimensions against the benchmark "20_best":

FSM 1 (20_1):

1. State Coverage: 5 - Covers key states like assess situation, reach device, confirm alert and call for help, but misses states for waiting, using device if help delayed.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Reasonably good connectivity between states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Simplistic linear state transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Tries to call for help but no contingency if help delayed.  

5. Scalability: 4 - Hardcoded states make extensions difficult.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Functional but lacks personalization.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses 11 benchmark actions like Reaching, Grasping, Lowering, Pressing, Calling.

Overall Score: 5.3

FSM 2 (20_2):

1. State Coverage: 7 - Covers monitoring elderly, retrieving device, activating device and calling for help.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Good connectivity between states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Simplistic linear state transitions.  

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Activates device before calling for help.

5. Scalability: 6 - States are encapsulated making extensions possible.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Provides contextual interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses 13 benchmark actions like Reaching, Gripping, Transporting, Pressing.

Overall Score: 6.6

FSM 3 (20_3):  

1. State Coverage: 7 - Assesses situation, retrieves device if needed, calls emergency if can't assist. 

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Some disconnected branches around helping stand.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Some interconnections between states.  

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Calls emergency service if unable to assist person in standing.

5. Scalability: 7 - States are mostly encapsulated.  

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Functional but not personalized.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Custom actions like deliver, support, transport instead of benchmark verbs.

Overall Score: 5.7

FSM 4 (20_4):

1. State Coverage: 4 - Only assesses situation and retrieves device.  

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Disconnected branches.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Minimal interconnections.

4. Safety Mindset: 5 - Provides device but doesn't ensure activation.  

5. Scalability: 5 - Hardcoded states make extension difficult.

6. Assistance UX: 3 - Very rigid flow.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Uses Grasp, Carry, Hand device from benchmark list.

Overall Score: 4.3

In summary, 20_2 has the best coverage of states, transitions and overall safety mindset. 20_3 encapsulates complexity better for scalability. 20_1 aligns well with standard actions. And 20_4 ranks lowest across most dimensions. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
