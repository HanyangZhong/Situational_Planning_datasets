 Here are my analysis and scores of the FSMs:

17_1:
1. State Coverage: 6/10 - Covers main states but lacks detail handling child reactions 
2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Decent transitions but lacks fallback handling
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Simplistic linear state transitions
4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Attempts to block stairs but lacks redundant safety checks
5. Scalability: 8/10 - Encapsulates states well for extensions
6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - Very functional, not personalized interactions  
7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Leverages defined action verbs well

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.9/10

17_2:
1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Handles multiple key scenarios
2. Transition Coverage: 9/10 - Robust connectivity between states  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Allows for some recursive transitions
4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Prioritizes safety checks before taking action
5. Scalability: 7/10 - Decently encapsulated but tightly coupled
6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very mechanical task handling  
7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Closely aligns with reference action lexicon

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.9/10

17_3:
1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Approaches secondary aspects like calming child
2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Handles core paths but lacks contingency plans
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10 - Simplistic linear state machine
4. Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Seeks to reduce risk before acting
5. Scalability: 5/10 - Not well abstracted from base scenario  
6. Assistance UX: 8/10 - Friendly contextual interactions
7. Action Set Alignment: 6/10 - Mixes custom and standard actions

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4/10

17_4: 
1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Touches key aspects, monitoring, barriers
2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Allows some state looping  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Most states have singular transition  
4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Leads with safety assessments
5. Scalability: 6/10 - Tightly fit to exact scenario
6. Assistance UX: 4/10 - Very functional, not relational  
7. Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Samples defined actions adequately

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.6/10

In summary, 17_2 has the most robust FSM design leveraging safety, scalability and aligning behaviors with the standard action lexicon. 17_1 takes a simplistic but fairly scalable approach. 17_3 has the most contextual UX but weaker contingency handling. 17_4 prioritizes safety checks but lacks complexity and personalization.
