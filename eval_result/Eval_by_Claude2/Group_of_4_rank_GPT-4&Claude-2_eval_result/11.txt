 Here is my analysis of the FSMs compared to the 11_best benchmark:

11_1 Analysis:
1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers main states but misses calling for additional help if needed
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Generally good coverage but no transitions to get help
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Fairly simple but could allow more optional paths 
4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Focuses on task completion but less consideration for safety
5. Scalability: 8 - Structure makes adding states/transitions feasible
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very task-oriented interactions 
7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Introduces custom actions rather than drawing from standard set

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3

Strengths: 
- Models main steps to complete medicine delivery task
- Simple structure allows modifications

Weaknesses: 
- No fallback states if delivery fails
- Very rigid user experience  

11_2 Analysis: 
1. State Coverage: 7 - Primary states covered but calls for help too quickly
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Calls for help even if medicine is reachable  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Straightforward logic but limited flexibility
4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Prioritizes calling for help if needed   
5. Scalability: 7 - Somewhat modular for extensions
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Only evaluates physical needs, less personal  
7. Action Set Alignment: 2 - Fully custom action set

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7  

Strengths:  
- Focuses on safety with call for help
- Assesses if person is unable to reach medicine
 
Weaknesses:
- Calls for help even if task may be feasible 
- No confirmation of medicine delivery  

11_3 Analysis:  
1. State Coverage: 5 - Covers core task but lacks safety/fallback states  
2. Transition Coverage: 4 - Task transitions only, no additional links
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very linear structure       
4. Safety Mindset: 2 - No mechanisms to ensure safety or deal with failures
5. Scalability: 7 - Modular design makes adding states feasible
6. Assistance UX: 1 - Purely focused on physical actions   
7. Action Set Alignment: 1 - Entirely custom verb set 

Overall Benchmark Score: 3.3
 
Strengths:  
- Simple linear steps for medicine delivery task   
- Leverages functions to allow modular extensions

Weaknesses:   
- No consideration for safety or failures
- Very rigid movement from one state to next

11_4 Analysis:   
1. State Coverage: 7 - Has states to cover main scenario    
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Decent transitions but no fallback  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly straightforward structure  
4. Safety Mindset: 4 - Monitors person but no help calls
5. Scalability: 8 - Loosely coupled functions enable extensions   
6. Assistance UX: 2 - Very robotic interactions    
7. Action Set Alignment: 2 - Primarily custom verbs
   
Overall Benchmark Score: 5
 
Strengths:  
- Monitors person continuously   
- Modular functions make additional states easier
   
Weaknesses:   
- No mechanisms for safety or contingencies
- Poor person-centric user experience
