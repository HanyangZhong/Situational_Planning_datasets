 Based on the scoring dimensions you provided, here is my analysis of the additional FSMs compared to the 10_best benchmark:

FSM 10_1:
1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, moving obstruction, and monitoring for further issues. Does not explicitly handle calling for outside assistance.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Generally good coverage of transitions, but does not cover transitions back to assessing situation after calling for help.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly simple with linear transitions between states.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Attempts to clear obstructions and monitor for issues.
5. Scalability: 6 - Structure is reasonable but transitions are tightly coupled to specific obstacle.
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional focused on clearing obstructions. Little personalization.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages many actions like Checking, Grasping, Dragging, Releasing, Monitoring.

Overall Score: 6.4

FSM 10_2:
1. State Coverage: 9 - Thoroughly checks path status, handles moving and repositioning obstruction.
2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Fully covers transitions, but does not handle calling for assistance.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Several embedded decision states making fairly complex.
4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Carefully checks position to ensure proper assistance.
5. Scalability: 7 - Fairly extensible, but coupled to specific obstacle.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Very functional focused on clearing obstructions.
7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Comprehensively uses action verbs like Reaching, Gripping, Lifting, Lowering, Releasing, Transporting, Checking.

Overall Score: 8.0  

FSM 10_3:
1. State Coverage: 6 - Light coverage of key states to offer and provide assistance.
2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Has some gaps in transitions like after assistance provided.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very simple linear state transitions.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Offers personalized assistance.
5. Scalability: 7 - Simple structure is easily extensible.
6. Assistance UX: 8 - Personable interaction offering and confirming assistance.
7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Minimal use of formal action set vocabulary.

Overall Score: 5.6

FSM 10_4: 
1. State Coverage: 7 - Handles assessing situation, providing assistance, monitoring.
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Generally solid transitions, but gaps in complexity.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly simple cyclic transitions.
4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Aims to identify and resolve safety issues.  
5. Scalability: 7 - Encapsulates complexity relatively well.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Functional assistance interactions.
7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Minimal use of standardized action vocabulary.

Overall Score: 6.0

In summary, 10_2 has the highest overall benchmark score of 8.0 based on strong coverage of key states, transitions, safety mindset, and leveraging the standard action vocabulary. 10_1 follows closely behind at 6.4, while 10_3 and 10_4 have simpler FSM approaches reflected in lower scores of 5.6 and 6.0.
