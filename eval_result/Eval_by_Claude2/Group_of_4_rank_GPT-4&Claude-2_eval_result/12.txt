 Based on the scoring dimensions you provided, here is my analysis of the additional FSMs relative to the example "12_best":

FSM Code 12_1:
State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, cleaning room, monitoring woman. Lacks refinement/handling of specific hazard states.
Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent connectivity between states, but lacks transitions for if subsequent hazards detected. 
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Generally linear progression through states.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes cleaning and removing hazards before monitoring woman.
Scalability: 6 - Structure is extendable, but state names are tightly coupled to current scenario.  
Assistance UX: 5 - Very task-focused interactions.
Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages defined action set verbs like collecting, sweeping, arranging.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4

FSM Code 12_2:
State Coverage: 9 - Key states cover assessing, clearing hazards, adjusting furniture.
Transition Coverage: 8 - Monitors situation and re-engages if hazards return.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Simple cycles between assess, clear, monitor states.
Safety Mindset: 9 - Clear hazards is first priority. 
Scalability: 8 - Structure is reusable for multiple living spaces.
Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, lacks persona.
Action Set Alignment: 10 - Completely aligns with the provided action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.9  

FSM Code 12_3:  
State Coverage: 7 - Covers assessing and clearing hazards, but lacks refinement.
Transition Coverage: 5 - No connectivity between states.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strictly linear state transitions.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Focused on clearing hazards.
Scalability: 5 - Tightly coupled to specific scenario.
Assistance UX: 6 - Attempts limited occupant interactions.  
Action Set Alignment: 9 - Leverages most verbs from standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3

FSM Code 12_4:
State Coverage: 6 - Key states present but very abstract.  
Transition Coverage: 8 - Closed state loops with memory.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Simple state cycling.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Can detect and clear hazards.
Scalability: 7 - Structure is extendable.
Assistance UX: 3 - Very terse interactions.
Action Set Alignment: 4 - Leverages only a couple aligned verbs.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7

In summary, FSM code "12_2" scores closest to the example "12_best" due to its safety focus, scalability, and leveraging the standard action set. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
