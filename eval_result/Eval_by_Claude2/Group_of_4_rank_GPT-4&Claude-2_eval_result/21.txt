 Here is my analysis of the FSMs:

FSM 21_1:

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers key states like checking situation, reaching/pressing button, calling for help. But lacks states for assisting person.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Decent transitions between states, but no transitions once help is called.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Simplistic linear transitions from one state to next.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Tries to call for help but doesn't assist person. 

5. Scalability: 6/10 - Additional states can be added but transitions may get complex.

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very robotic, presses button without explaining or assisting.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses checking, reaching, pressing, calling for help.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4/10


FSM 21_2:

1. State Coverage: 6/10 - Covers checking situation and calling for help but no detailed assist.

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Very linear basic transitions.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Extremely simple transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 5/10 - Tries to call for help but no assist.

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Easy to add more states as needed.  

6. Assistance UX: 4/10 - Focuses only on task, no assist or explain.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Uses checking, moving, reaching, pressing, calling for help.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3/10


FSM 21_3:  

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Has assess, call for help, comfort states.

2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Decent transitions, could improve await help transitions.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Fairly linear simple transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Tries to call for help and comfort person.

5. Scalability: 8/10 - Easy to add more states as needed.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - Explains what it is doing but very simple. 

7. Action Set Alignment: 5/10 - Uses checking and calling for help.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3/10


FSM 21_4:

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Has assess, reposition, press button, wait for help.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Good set of transitions between states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Fairly linear simple transitions.  

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Tries to call for help and reposition person.

5. Scalability: 8/10 - Easy to add more states as needed.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - Explains actions but focus only on tasks.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3/10 - Uses custom actions, lacks alignment.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.1/10
