 Here is my analysis of the FSMs:

FSM 15_1:

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers key states to handle the main hazards, but does not include monitoring owner response or a final check state.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Decent connectivity between states, but lacks transitions from fixing one hazard to checking/handling others.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Mostly linear connections between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Prioritizes safety by handling hazards first, but lacks fallbacks if cat cannot be distracted.  

5. Scalability: 6/10 - Somewhat modular structure focused on hazard types, but transitions are still fairly hardcoded.

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very robotic, functional interactions focused only on tasks.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses some undefined custom actions like checking, but generally sticks to the action set.


FSM 15_2:

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Checks main hazard areas but lacks separate end state or owner contact.

2. Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Checks each hazard type then loops back, but linear.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Very simple sequencing between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Prioritizes resolving hazards first.

5. Scalability: 5/10 - Structure around hazard types helps but still fairly rigid.  

6. Assistance UX: 4/10 - Purely functional, no customization or natural language.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Almost entirely sticks to the defined action set.


FSM 15_3: 

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Has states for main hazards but lacks owner contact or final check.

2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Loops through hazard identification but transitions are linear.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Little interconnectivity between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Focuses on mitigating hazards.

5. Scalability: 8/10 - Structure based on hazard types makes extending easier.

6. Assistance UX: 4/10 - Very mechanistic, non-personalized interactions.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 10/10 - Strictly uses only actions from standard set.


FSM 15_4:

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers key states, just lacks owner contact and final check.  

2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Loops between hazards but transitions are simplistic.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Minimal interconnectivity between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Resolving hazards is the priority.   

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Some modularity around hazards.

6. Assistance UX: 3/10 - No customization or natural language for user.

7. Action Set Alignment: 10/10 - Uses only actions from the defined vocabulary.


In summary:

FSM 15_1 Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4/10

FSM 15_2 Overall Benchmark Score: 6.1/10  

FSM 15_3 Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3/10

FSM 15_4 Overall Benchmark Score: 6.6/10

The key strengths tend to be prioritizing safety by handling hazards, while weaknesses include lack of connectivity between states, simplicity/linearity of transitions limiting complexity, and poor user experience quality. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
