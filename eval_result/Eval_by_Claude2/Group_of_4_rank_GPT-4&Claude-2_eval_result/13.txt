 Here is my analysis of the FSMs:

**13_1 Analysis**

State Coverage: 8 - Covers most necessary states but lacks some robustness such as explicitly checking the safety of the woman after actions.

Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions between states but lacks transitions back to earlier states if later ones fail.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear progression through states.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Secures chemicals and ventilates area but doesn't verify safety. 

Scalability: 6 - Additional states could be inserted but transitions may need overhaul.

Assistance UX: 5 - Informs the woman but interactions are basic.

Action Set Alignment: 6 - Uses 6 verbs from standard action set.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3**

**13_2 Analysis** 

State Coverage: 9 - Thorough states including monitoring before and after actions.

Transition Coverage: 8 - Robust transitions between states.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Some interconnectedness between states.  

Safety Mindset: 9 - Verifies safety at multiple states.

Scalability: 7 - Additional states can extend functionality.

Assistance UX: 6 - Mostly monitoring, could be more assistive.

Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses 7 verbs from the standard action set.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 7.7**


**13_3 Analysis**

State Coverage: 6 - Covers key states but lacks depth in each one.

Transition Coverage: 5 - Transitions are simplistic back and forth between two states.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very linear through states.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Addresses risk but doesn't verify mitigation.

Scalability: 7 - Easy to add states and transitions.  

Assistance UX: 4 - Very basic interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 6 - Uses 6 verbs from the standard action set.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 5.6**


**13_4 Analysis** 

State Coverage: 7 - Necessary states covered but misses explicit safety checks.

Transition Coverage: 6 - Decent transitions but lacks robustness. 

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Mostly linear progression between states.

Safety Mindset: 6 - Mitigates risk but has no verification.

Scalability: 7 - Additional states can be inserted fairly easily.

Assistance UX: 5 - Very directive toward woman.  

Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses 8 verbs from the standard action set.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3**

In summary, 13_2 has the highest overall benchmark score of 7.7 with strengths in safety mindset and transition coverage. 13_3 scored the lowest at 5.6 due to simplicity. The others were fairly close in overall score. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
