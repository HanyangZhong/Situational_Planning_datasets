 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided compared to the example "14_best":

14_1 Analysis:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, removing hazards, monitoring, and calling for help. Does not explicitly handle pet distraction/redirection.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Good transitions between states, but lacks transitions back to monitoring if distractions fail.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Reasonably interconnected states without too much complexity.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Proactively removes hazards and monitors, but lacks emergency response capability.  

5. Scalability: 6 - Encapsulates key functions, but tightly couples state transitions.

6. Assistance UX: 6 -Handles assistance but interactions could be more natural.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses relevant actions like gripping, lifting, transporting, but also introduces some custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7


14_2 Analysis: 

1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers key states for monitoring, removing hazards, relocating pet, securing area and alerting owner.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Good coverage of transitions, but lacks fallbacks if relocation or securing area fails.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Reasonable interconnections without much complexity.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Proactively handles hazards and alerts owner.

5. Scalability: 7 - Decouples some key behaviors but transitions are still coupled.  

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Provides assistance but could be more natural.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Uses very relevant actions from benchmark list.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8


14_3 Analysis:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Handles assessing, removing hazards, cleanup and monitoring. Lacks explicit pet redirection.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent coverage of state changes, but lacks fallbacks if states fail.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Reasonably simple interconnected states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Removes hazards reactively but lacks emergency response.

5. Scalability: 8 - Encapsulates behaviors well, simplifying additions.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Provides assistance, but interactions are robotic.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages relevant actions from standard vocabulary.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.1


14_4 Analysis:  

1. State Coverage: 7 - Covers assessment, hazard removal, pet redirection and monitoring.

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Handles some key transitions, but lacks complexity.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very simple state connectivity lacking nuance.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Removes hazards reactively.

5. Scalability: 7 - Reasonably encapsulated behaviors.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very simple rigid assistance. 

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses very applicable action verbs.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6

In summary, 14_2 has the highest overall benchmark score of 8 out of 10. It strikes a good balance of coverage, safety, scalability while leveraging the standard action vocabulary. 14_1 also scores reasonably well but lacks certain state coverage. 14_3 is decent with certain strengths like scalability but is let down by complexity and UX. 14_4 covers basics but lacks nuance and UX polish at the moment.
