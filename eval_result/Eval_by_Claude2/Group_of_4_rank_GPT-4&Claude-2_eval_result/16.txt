 Here is my analysis of the FSMs compared to the "16_best" example:

**16_1 Analysis:**

State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers key states like assessing situation, clearing hazards, monitoring, and calling for help when needed. Does not explicitly show states for engaging child in other activities.  

Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Main transitions are there, but lacks transitions from monitoring back to initial state.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Each state generally transitions linearly to the next one. 

Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Proactively clears hazards and monitors situation.

Scalability: 6/10 - Somewhat modular, but state names are tailored narrowly to this exact scenario.

Assistance UX: 5/10 - Focused on safety, but interactions lack nuance.

Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses 16 distinct actions from standard set.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 7.0**

**16_2 Analysis:** 

State Coverage: 7/10 - Covers assessment, moving child, moving objects, and monitoring. No explicit initial or help states.

Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Has transitions between key states, but lacks nuanced branches.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Very linear simple transitions between each state.

Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Prioritizes moving child first.  

Scalability: 5/10 - States specific to scenario, but actions show some reusability.  

Assistance UX: 3/10 - Very functional, but no personalized interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Uses 14 standard actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 5.6**


**16_3 Analysis:**

State Coverage: 8/10 - Has states for assessment, child redirection, securing objects, monitoring, and getting help.

Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Hits key transitions, but lacks nuanced branches.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Mostly linear progression between states.

Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Secures objects before full monitoring. 

Scalability: 7/10 - States abstracted beyond just this scenario.

Assistance UX: 5/10 - Attempts some child engagement.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Uses 19 standard actions.  

**Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3**


**16_4 Analysis:**

State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers movement, securing hazards, engagement, and monitoring. No explicit help state.  

Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Progresses linearly through states.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Each state has one following state.  

Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Prioritizes securing hazards first.

Scalability: 6/10 - Some reusable states and actions.

Assistance UX: 5/10 - Attempts child engagement tactics.  

Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses 17 standard actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 5.9**
