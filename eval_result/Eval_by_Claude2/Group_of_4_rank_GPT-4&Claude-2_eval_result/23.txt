 Here are my analysis and scores for the FSMs provided:

FSM 23_1:
1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, calming dog, engaging child. Lacks nuanced states.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Mostly good coverage of likely state changes, but gaps in some edges. 
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Basic interconnectedness between about 5 key states.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - tries to calm dog, remind child safety, reduce risk. But gaps.  
5. Scalability: 6 - Structure is decent but tightly coupled code could limit extending.
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very robotic interactions with dog and child.
7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Uses about 10 general actions loosely aligned with standard set.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0

FSM 23_2:
1. State Coverage: 7 - Key states present but lacks nuance.
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Covers core transitions but lacks edge cases.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Simply interconnected centered on monitoring play.
4. Safety Mindset: 5 - Calls help but focus not preventing harm. 
5. Scalability: 7 - Some modularization helps adding states.
6. Assistance UX: 4 - Distraction uses toy but very robotic.
7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Few selected actions, not aligned with standard set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.1  

FSM 23_3:
1. State Coverage: 3 - Only covers core interaction with dog & child. Major gaps.
2. Transition Coverage: 2 - Transitions between a couple states, lacks complexity.  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Very linear, lacking interconnectivity.
4. Safety Mindset: 4 - Redirects dog from rough play as safety. 
5. Scalability: 3 - Hardcoded sequences resist adding complexity.
6. Assistance UX: 1 - Simply fulfills functions, extremely rigid. 
7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Decent alignment on few actions like grasping and transporting toy.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 2.7

FSM 23_4:
1. State Coverage: 7 - Checks for play intensity and clear conclusion. Gaps in nuance. 
2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Covers core likely sequences of escalating interventions.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Loops back from concluding to observing. Lacks density.  
4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Transitions to intervene based on safety analysis.
5. Scalability: 7 - Some modularization enables extending states and actions.  
6. Assistance UX: 4 - Warning is caring but concluding play is rigid.
7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Aligns with a subset of key actions like move, grab, lead.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.1
