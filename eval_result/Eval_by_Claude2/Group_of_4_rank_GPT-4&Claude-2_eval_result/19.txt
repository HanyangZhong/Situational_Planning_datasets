 Here are my analysis and scores of the FSMs provided:

FSM 1 ("19_1"):

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers most necessary states like assessing situation, distracting child, moving hazard, monitoring, and calling for help. Does not explicitly handle securing child safety.  

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Logical transitions between states, but does not cover all sequences like child continuing to be in danger after distraction.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Has a linear sequence of states with some loops for monitoring. Reasonably complex structure.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Key safety steps are present like distracting child and moving hazard, but could do more to directly secure child.

5. Scalability: 6/10 - Structure is decently encapsulated but transitions based on hard-coded logic checks could limit adaptability.

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Some positive actions like providing toys and reminders, but interactions seem robotic overall.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses many prescribed actions like monitoring, delivering, gripping, transporting. Minimal external actions.


Overall Benchmark Score: 6.6/10


FSM 2 ("19_2"):

1. State Coverage: 5/10 - Covers assessing situation, moving child, and calling for help. Lacks detail and misses key states.

2. Transition Coverage: 4/10 - Very linear, does not address possible looping back based on ongoing risk.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2/10 - Strictly linear sequence of states. Too simplistic.

4. Safety Mindset: 6/10 - Focuses on moving child away from risk which is good, but very lightweight handling overall.

5. Scalability: 3/10 - Hard-coded transitions and minimal states limit ability to extend FSM functionality.

6. Assistance UX: 3/10 - Very impersonal and task-driven interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 6/10 - Leverages some prescribed actions like gripping, transporting, but misses many relevant ones.


Overall Benchmark Score: 4.3/10


FSM 3 ("19_3"):

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Approaching child, redirecting away from hazard, handling stove, and monitoring are useful states. No help calling.

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Loops back to monitoring, but linear otherwise. Risk of getting stuck repeatedly approaching child. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Strictly linear except for monitor state transitions. Overly simplistic structure. 

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Actively moves child away from stove which is critical. But very lightweight handling.

5. Scalability: 4/10 - State functionality is not well encapsulated which could limit extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - More natural verbal interactions but quite minimal.

7. Action Set Alignment: 2/10 - No prescribed actions explicitly encoded, mostly custom print statements.


Overall Benchmark Score: 4.7/10


FSM 4 ("19_4"):  

1. State Coverage: 6/10 - Approaching child, moving away, handling stove, calling for help. No active monitoring.

2. Transition Coverage: 4/10 - Largely linear with call for help ending sequence. Risk of getting stuck in loop.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2/10 - Strictly linear except for terminal call for help state. Very simplistic structure.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Actively moves child away from stove risk which is critical.

5. Scalability: 3/10 - State functionality not well abstracted, could hinder extending.

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - More natural verbal interactions but still fairly minimal. 

7. Action Set Alignment: 1/10 - No prescribed actions used, primarily custom print statements.


Overall Benchmark Score: 4.0/10

In summary, FSM 1 has the strongest overall benchmark score due to reasonably good coverage of necessary states and transitions, safety mindset, and leveraging the standard action vocabulary. The other FSMs are weaker in assessing risk, handling contingencies, encapsulating complexity, and utilizing the prescribed action set.
