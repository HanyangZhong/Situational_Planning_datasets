 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided against the benchmark "1_best":

1_1:
State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers most key states but does not check shower or do final verification.
Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Generally flows well between states but no conditional transitions based on environment. 
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Linear state transitions without much interconnectivity.
Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Checks for wet floor but does not verify cleanup.
Scalability: 6/10 - Additional states can be inserted but overall structure is rigid.  
Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very robotic, does not adapt to user needs.
Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses most verbs appropriately but also introduces additional custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4/10

1_2: 
State Coverage: 7/10 - Covers key states to handle various situations but no final verification.
Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Good connectivity and returns to assess state between tasks.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10 - Some conditional complexity but quite linear.
Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Checks situations but does limited verification. 
Scalability: 7/10 - Modular states make extensions easier.
Assistance UX: 6/10 - Very functional but not personalized.
Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Strictly sticks to defined action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.1/10

1_3:
State Coverage: 7/10 – Handles main elements but does not check shower or do final verification.
Transition Coverage: 6/10 – Generally flows well but transitions are simplistic.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 – Mostly linear with minimal interconnectivity between states.  
Safety Mindset: 5/10 – Limited safety checks and verification.
Scalability: 7/10 – Additional states can be inserted reasonably easily.
Assistance UX: 4/10 – Very robotic, does not adapt to user. 
Action Set Alignment: 8/10 – Uses verbs appropriately but also introduces some custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7/10

1_4: 
State Coverage: 8/10 – Covers most critical states, does not do final verification.
Transition Coverage: 7/10 – Decent connectivity between states.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 – Strictly linear transitions from one state to next.
Safety Mindset: 5/10 – Does not actively verify safety.
Scalability: 5/10 – Hard to modify rigid linear structure.
Assistance UX: 3/10 – No personalization or context awareness.  
Action Set Alignment: 10/10 – Uses verbs from standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0/10

In summary, 1_2 has the highest overall benchmark score of 7.1/10 by having good state coverage, conditional transitions, safety checks, and strict use of the action verb vocabulary. 1_1 covers important states but is rigid and introduces custom actions. 1_3 and 1_4 are quite linear and lack interconnectivity between states.
