 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs based on the scoring dimensions you provided:

FSM 1 (Code 7_1):

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers most key states like assessing, cleaning, arranging shoes/items, checking staircase. Does not handle calling for help explicitly.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Generally good coverage of likely state transitions. Lacks fallback transitions if states fail.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linear state transitions without much branching complexity.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to clean and arrange items to prevent harm. But lacks robust failure handling.

5. Scalability: 6 - Structure is decent but transitions are tightly coupled to specific states.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, but interactions lack personalization or context.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses relevant actions like cleaning, arranging, fixing, checking states. But also introduces some custom actions.

Overall Score: 6.7

FSM 2 (Code 7_2):

1. State Coverage: 5 - Covers assessing and cleaning states but lacks detail in other areas.

2. Transition Coverage: 4 - Transitions between assess, pickup and arrange states. But lacks complexity or fallback handling.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very linear state transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Tries to clear clutter to prevent harm. But safety handling is limited.

5. Scalability: 5 - Structure is simple but entangled with specific states hindering extension. 

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very mechanical interaction approach.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Leverages many relevant actions like reaching, gripping, lifting, etc. But also adds some custom actions.

Overall Score: 5.0

FSM 3 (Code 7_3): 

1. State Coverage: 7 - Handles assessment, clearing hazards, fixing rug and monitoring. Lacks storage/arrangement considerations.

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Reasonable transitions based on assessed hazards. Lacks fallback handling.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Mostly linear state transitions. 

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Explicitly handles tripping hazards and adds monitoring.

5. Scalability: 7 - Structure is organized well to allow extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Communicates actions but lacks personalization.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses very relevant actions for home assistance scenario.

Overall Score: 6.9

FSM 4 (Code 7_4):

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers assessment, clearing, hazards, securing and check completeness. Minimal gaps.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Logical transitions based on assessed conditions. Lacks fallback handling.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linear state transitions without much branching.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Addresses safety by clearing hazards and checking stability. But handling could be more comprehensive.  

5. Scalability: 8 - Structure and state encapsulation enables extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Communicates actions clearly but lacks personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Leverages highly relevant actions for home assistance scenario.  

Overall Score: 7.0

In summary, FSMs 1 and 3 score best in state coverage, transitions, safety mindset, scalability and action alignment. But there are opportunities for improvement across interaction design, complexity handling and overall robustness. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
