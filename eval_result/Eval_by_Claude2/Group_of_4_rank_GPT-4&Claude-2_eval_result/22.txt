 Here is my analysis of the FSMs:

FSM 22_1:

1. State Coverage: 6/10 - Covers some important states like monitoring, moving to the button, and assisting the woman, but lacks states for more detailed assessment or explicit external help.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Connections between states generally make sense, but no branches based on different conditions.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Very linear flow from one state to the next. Could benefit from more interconnectivity.  

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Seeks to assist the woman but does not explicitly call for help if her condition is dire.

5. Scalability: 8/10 - Breaks down the scenario into logical states and helper functions, fairly modular.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - Assists the woman but the states themselves sound somewhat robotic.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses relevant actions like reaching, pressing, monitoring though does not utilize the full benchmark list.

Overall Score: 6.7/10

FSM 22_2:

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Checks if woman has fallen and cannot reach the button, but minimal assessment and help states.

2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Logical transitions focused just on button pressing task.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Very linear set of states.

4. Safety Mindset: 5/10 - Transitions to call for help state but as a backup rather than priority.

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Modular with helper functions, but overall system is narrow.  

6. Assistance UX: 4/10 - Very task oriented, does not explicitly assist, comfort or monitor woman.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5/10 - Defines states relevant to physical actions but does not utilize full action benchmark.

Overall Score: 5.4/10

FSM 22_3:  

1. State Coverage: 6/10 - Checks on woman and brings her to alert, but no external help or detailed assessment.

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Strange transitions like transport then activate alert rather than the reverse order.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Very linear set of states.

4. Safety Mindset: 5/10 - Lifts and transports woman but no clear safety precautions.  

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Outlines clear states as starting points to build out details.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - Helps woman reach alert but actions could be more supportive.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Uses physical actions like lift, transport and monitor.

Overall Score: 5.6/10

FSM 22_4:

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Checks woman's condition, supports her, presses alert and monitors situation.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Logical progression through assisting states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Very linear states without branching complexity.

4. Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Explicitly supports woman carefully and activates emergency alert.

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Helper functions enable adding complexity in each state's logic.

6. Assistance UX: 7/10 - Supports woman physically and activates alert on her behalf.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 6/10 - Uses support, press and monitor actions.

Overall Score: 6.7/10

In summary, FSM 22_4 has the highest overall score because it balances and prioritizes the woman's safety and condition, while also signaling for emergency help. FSM 22_1 and 22_2 cover some basics but do not match 22_4's care for the woman and scalability. FSM 22_3 focuses more narrowly just on transporting the woman and activating the alert in an oddly ordered sequence. Let me know if you have any other questions!
