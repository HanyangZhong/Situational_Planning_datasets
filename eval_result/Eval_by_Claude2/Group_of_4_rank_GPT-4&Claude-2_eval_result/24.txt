 Here are my detailed scores and analysis for each additional FSM compared to the example "24_best":

**FSM: 24_1**

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, removing hazards, engaging child, monitoring play and calling for help. Slightly lacks coverage of follow-up states after initial hazard removal.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Good transitions between states, but lacks some transitions back to monitoring after engaging child.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Slightly interconnected between states, but transitions are mostly linear.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Clear focus on identifying and removing hazards, then monitoring child safety.

5. Scalability: 6 - Some encapsulation of states, but high coupling between states could limit extensions.  

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very functional approach but not personalized or contextual interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Generally aligns well with established action set, introducing only a couple new actions like checking toys.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 7**


**FSM: 24_2**

1. State Coverage: 7 - Key states of monitoring, removing hazards, getting help. Lacks follow-up after initial actions.

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Decent transitions, but linear in parts with no loops back to monitoring.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Largely linear transitions from one state to next.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Clear safety focus on removing hazards and calling for help.  

5. Scalability: 7 - Some modularization between states could enable extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Functional interactions but lacks personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Closely aligns with the established action set.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 6**


**FSM: 24_3** 

1. State Coverage: 7 - Covers key states of identifying hazards, securing unsafe toys, redirecting child. Lacks transitions back to monitoring.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Linear sequence of states, transitions don't loop back to monitoring.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strict linear state transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Clear focus on securing hazards and redirecting child.

5. Scalability: 8 - Well encapsulated states support extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 3 - Very mechanical interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Uses established action vocabulary.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 6**


**FSM: 24_4**

1. State Coverage: 5 - Minimal states of monitoring, engaging child, removing hazards. Many key states lacking.

2. Transition Coverage: 4 - Transitions present between a couple states but no loops. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Very linear transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Focuses on monitoring safety and removing hazards.

5. Scalability: 4 - High coupling between states limits extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 2 - No personalized or contextual interactions.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Generally uses established action set.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 4**

In summary, FSM 24_1 has the highest overall benchmark score of 7 owing to reasonably strong coverage of key states and transitions focused on safety. FSMs 24_2 and 24_3 score a 6 with decent safety approaches but more linear state handling. FSM 24_4 has the lowest score of 4 due to minimal states, transitions and interactions.
