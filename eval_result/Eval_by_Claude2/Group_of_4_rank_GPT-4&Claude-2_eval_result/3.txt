 Here is my analysis of the FSMs "3_1", "3_2", "3_3" and "3_4" based on the provided scoring dimensions, compared to the benchmark "3_best" FSM:

3_1 FSM:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, extinguishing flame, preserving tea, placing glasses. Does not handle post-resolution monitoring.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Generally good coverage of transitions between states. Lacks transitions back to assess state from other states. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linear transitions from assess state, not too complex.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes extinguishing flame over other states.

5. Scalability: 6 - Reasonably extensible, but state responsibilities are broad.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Functionally assists with the situation, but interactions are basic.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses 16 out of 56 actions like gripping, squeezing, heating, placing down.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

3_2 FSM: 

1. State Coverage: 7 - Checks situation, handles candle, requests help. No post-resolution monitoring.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Transitions between states, but lacks nuanced branches.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very linear set of transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Removes candle if dangerous before seeking help. 

5. Scalability: 7 - Encapsulates key behaviors in states for extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, not personalized.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses 10 out of 56 actions like gripping, lifting, transporting.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.1


3_3 FSM:

1. State Coverage: 9 - Assesses risk, removes hazards, extinguishes, cleans up, monitors.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Branches based on risk levels and loops back to monitoring.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - A bit interconnected between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Prioritizes removing combustibles first. 

5. Scalability: 8 - Logically divided states to build upon.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, not much personalization.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Only uses 2 out of 56 actions - sensing and removing.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.9


3_4 FSM:  

1. State Coverage: 8 - Assesses, extinguishes, cleans up, monitors. But methods handle details.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Covers key transitions, but lacks branches.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Overall fairly linear transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Extinguishes before cleaning up.

5. Scalability: 8 - States abstract away specifics for extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, not personalized.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses only 4 out of 56 actions - checking, extinguishing, removing, tidying.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6

To summarize, 3_3 has the strongest state coverage, safety approach, and scalability. However, 3_1 better leverages the standard action set. 3_4 is simple but less nuanced, while 3_2 focuses strictly on the candle risk. The overall scores help rank their relative quality.
