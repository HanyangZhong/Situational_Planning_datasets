To evaluate and compare the FSMs in "11_3" and "11_4" against the benchmark established by "11_best", we will analyze each FSM across the seven specified dimensions, providing scores on a scale from 0 to 10. The "11_best" FSM will serve as the gold standard with perfect scores (10s) in all dimensions. 

### 1. State Coverage
- **11_best**: Perfect coverage (Score: 10).
- **11_3**: Lacks states like 'ENSURE_COMFORT', 'MONITOR_PATIENT', and 'DELIVER_MEDICINE'. (Score: 6).
- **11_4**: Adds 'COMFORT_PATIENT' and 'MONITOR_PATIENT', improving coverage. Still lacks 'DELIVER_MEDICINE'. (Score: 8).

### 2. Transition Coverage
- **11_best**: Complete transition coverage (Score: 10).
- **11_3**: Misses some transitions like from 'GIVE_MEDICINE' to 'MONITOR_PATIENT'. (Score: 6).
- **11_4**: Improved transitions, but still lacks some like 'DELIVER_MEDICINE' to 'ENSURE_COMFORT'. (Score: 8).

### 3. Cyclomatic Complexity
- **11_best**: Balanced complexity (Score: 10).
- **11_3**: Simpler, less interconnected (Score: 5).
- **11_4**: More complex than "11_3", but not as interconnected as "11_best" (Score: 7).

### 4. Safety Mindset
- **11_best**: High emphasis on safety (Score: 10).
- **11_3**: Limited safety measures, no 'ENSURE_COMFORT' or continuous monitoring (Score: 5).
- **11_4**: Improves with 'COMFORT_PATIENT' and 'MONITOR_PATIENT', but still lacks some safety aspects (Score: 8).

### 5. Scalability
- **11_best**: Highly scalable (Score: 10).
- **11_3**: Less scalable due to missing states and transitions (Score: 5).
- **11_4**: More scalable than "11_3", but not as much as "11_best" (Score: 7).

### 6. Assistance UX
- **11_best**: Natural and contextual (Score: 10).
- **11_3**: More robotic and rigid interactions (Score: 4).
- **11_4**: Improved UX but still lacks the naturalness of "11_best" (Score: 6).

### 7. Action Set Alignment
- **11_best**: Strictly adheres to the action set vocabulary (Score: 10).
- **11_3** and **11_4**: Both adhere to the action set vocabulary but are less comprehensive than "11_best". However, "11_4" shows improvement over "11_3" (11_3 Score: 6, 11_4 Score: 8).

### Overall Benchmark Scores
To calculate the Overall Benchmark Score for each FSM, we average the ratings across all dimensions.

#### FSM "11_3":
\[ (6 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 6) / 7 \] ≈ 5.29

#### FSM "11_4":
\[ (8 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 8) / 7 \] ≈ 7.43

### Summary
- **11_3** shows fundamental functionality but lacks in several aspects, particularly in safety mindset, UX, and scalability.
- **11_4** makes significant improvements over "11_3", particularly in safety and state coverage, but still falls short of the benchmark set by "11_best" in terms of complexity and natural UX.
