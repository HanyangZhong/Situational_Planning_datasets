To evaluate the FSMs in the codes "18_3" and "18_4" against the benchmark established by "18_best", I'll score each FSM across the seven dimensions you've provided. The "18_best" FSM will serve as a reference point with perfect 10s in all dimensions.

### Analysis of "18_3" FSM

1. **State Coverage (6/10)**: Covers key states like assessing the situation, covering the outlet, engaging the child, and calling for help. However, it lacks specific states for ensuring child safety or monitoring the environment, which are present in "18_best".

2. **Transition Coverage (7/10)**: Good transition coverage, moving between states based on child's proximity to the outlet and safety risks. However, it misses transitions like moving from 'Engage Child' directly to 'Call for Help'.

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity (5/10)**: Moderately complex with several interconnected states, but not as densely interconnected as "18_best".

4. **Safety Mindset (8/10)**: Strong focus on child safety through proactive outlet covering and engagement, but less comprehensive in ensuring safety compared to "18_best".

5. **Scalability (6/10)**: The FSM structure allows for some extension but is less adaptable to new contexts compared to "18_best".

6. **Assistance UX (7/10)**: Good user experience by engaging the child and covering the outlet, but lacks the continuous monitoring and adaptive response of "18_best".

7. **Action Set Alignment (8/10)**: Mostly adheres to the standard action set vocabulary, but introduces some custom actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score for "18_3" FSM: (6+7+5+8+6+7+8)/7 ≈ 6.7**

### Analysis of "18_4" FSM

1. **State Coverage (7/10)**: Improved state coverage including warning and moving the child away. However, it still misses a dedicated state for ensuring child safety.

2. **Transition Coverage (8/10)**: Better transition coverage, including backtracking to assess the situation. More comprehensive than "18_3" but still not as complete as "18_best".

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity (6/10)**: Increased complexity with additional states and transitions, but not as interconnected as "18_best".

4. **Safety Mindset (9/10)**: Very high focus on child safety with proactive measures and direct intervention, almost on par with "18_best".

5. **Scalability (7/10)**: Improved scalability with more states that can be adapted to new contexts, but still less flexible than "18_best".

6. **Assistance UX (8/10)**: Enhanced user experience through direct engagement and verbal warnings, showing a more natural and contextual interaction.

7. **Action Set Alignment (7/10)**: Generally adheres to the action set vocabulary but introduces some actions outside the standard list.

**Overall Benchmark Score for "18_4" FSM: (7+8+6+9+7+8+7)/7 ≈ 7.4**

### Summary

- **"18_3" FSM** has a good focus on child safety and reasonable state and transition coverage, but lacks in complexity and scalability. It's more rigid in user experience compared to "18_best".
- **"18_4" FSM** shows significant improvement in safety mindset, user experience, and state coverage. It's more scalable and complex than "18_3" but still falls short of the benchmark set by "18_best".

These scores offer a quantitative and qualitative comparison to fine-tune home assistance robots, highlighting areas for improvement in both FSMs relative to the "18_best" benchmark.
