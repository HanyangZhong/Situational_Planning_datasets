To evaluate the Finite State Machines (FSMs) "10_3" and "10_4" against the benchmark established by "10_best" across seven dimensions, I will first provide a detailed analysis for each FSM in each dimension. Then, I'll calculate their Overall Benchmark Scores based on these dimensions. 

### Evaluation of "10_3" FSM

#### 1. State Coverage
- **Score: 8/10**
- "10_3" has a good range of states covering the scenario, but lacks the explicit handling of safety or failure scenarios like "10_best" does with its 'CALL_FAMILY' state.

#### 2. Transition Coverage
- **Score: 7/10**
- Transitions are well-covered for typical scenarios, but there's less robustness in unexpected situations compared to "10_best".

#### 3. Cyclomatic Complexity
- **Score: 5/10**
- The FSM is simpler with fewer states and transitions, reducing complexity compared to "10_best".

#### 4. Safety Mindset
- **Score: 6/10**
- Safety considerations seem implicit in actions but are not explicitly addressed as in "10_best".

#### 5. Scalability
- **Score: 6/10**
- Modifiable, but integrating new scenarios might be more challenging than with "10_best".

#### 6. Assistance UX
- **Score: 7/10**
- The user experience seems effective but might lack the responsiveness and adaptability of "10_best".

#### 7. Action Set Alignment
- **Score: 9/10**
- Closely aligns with the defined action set vocabulary, showing only minor deviations.

### Evaluation of "10_4" FSM

#### 1. State Coverage
- **Score: 9/10**
- Includes most necessary states and introduces 'CALL_FOR_HELP', improving over "10_3" but still slightly behind "10_best".

#### 2. Transition Coverage
- **Score: 8/10**
- More comprehensive transition coverage than "10_3", accounting for more scenarios.

#### 3. Cyclomatic Complexity
- **Score: 6/10**
- A bit more complex than "10_3" due to additional states and transitions, but still less than "10_best".

#### 4. Safety Mindset
- **Score: 8/10**
- Improvement over "10_3", with explicit safety considerations, yet still not as thorough as "10_best".

#### 5. Scalability
- **Score: 7/10**
- Shows better potential for extension and adaptation than "10_3".

#### 6. Assistance UX
- **Score: 8/10**
- Enhanced user experience by addressing more scenarios and incorporating a call for help.

#### 7. Action Set Alignment
- **Score: 9/10**
- Maintains a strong alignment with the action set vocabulary, similar to "10_3".

### Overall Benchmark Scores

Now, let's calculate the Overall Benchmark Scores for each FSM:

#### "10_3" FSM
\[ (8 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 9) / 7 = \] **Overall Score**

#### "10_4" FSM
\[ (9 + 8 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 9) / 7 = \] **Overall Score**

Let's calculate these scores.

Based on the evaluations, the Overall Benchmark Scores are as follows:

- **"10_3" FSM:** The Overall Benchmark Score is approximately 6.86 out of 10.
- **"10_4" FSM:** The Overall Benchmark Score is approximately 7.86 out of 10.

These scores indicate that "10_4" is closer to the benchmark established by "10_best" across the evaluated dimensions, showing improvements particularly in State Coverage, Transition Coverage, Safety Mindset, and Assistance UX compared to "10_3". The addition of the 'CALL_FOR_HELP' state in "10_4" and its better alignment with safety and user experience aspects contribute to its higher score. 

Both FSMs demonstrate a good alignment with the Action Set Alignment, maintaining a strong adherence to the industry-standard action set vocabulary. However, "10_best" remains superior in terms of comprehensive state and transition coverage, as well as in its safety considerations and scalability, as reflected in the perfect score of 10 across all dimensions.
