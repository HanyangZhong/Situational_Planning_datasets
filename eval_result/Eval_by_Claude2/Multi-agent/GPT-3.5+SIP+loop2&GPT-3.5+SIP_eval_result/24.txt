To evaluate the Finite State Machines (FSMs) in the codes "24_3" and "24_4" against the benchmark established by "24_best", we'll analyze each FSM across the seven dimensions you've specified. Let's break down the assessment for each FSM and then calculate their Overall Benchmark Scores.

### Analysis of "24_3" FSM

1. **State Coverage**: This FSM covers most necessary states like 'ASSESS_TOYS', 'WARN_CHILD', 'MOVE_TOYS', 'MONITOR_PLAY', and 'CALL_FOR_HELP'. However, it lacks direct engagement with the child compared to "24_best". Score: 8/10.
2. **Transition Coverage**: Transitions are well-covered, but the return to 'IDLE' from 'CALL_FOR_HELP' may miss continuous monitoring. Score: 7/10.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: The FSM is moderately complex, with good connectivity but not as intricate as "24_best". Score: 6/10.
4. **Safety Mindset**: Safety is a clear focus, with states dedicated to warning and moving hazardous toys, but less proactive engagement with the child. Score: 8/10.
5. **Scalability**: It is somewhat scalable, but the rigid transition to 'IDLE' may limit adaptability. Score: 7/10.
6. **Assistance UX**: The FSM includes warnings and instructions to the child, but lacks direct engagement, making interactions less natural. Score: 7/10.
7. **Action Set Alignment**: This FSM mostly adheres to the action set vocabulary but introduces a few custom actions like 'instructing'. Score: 8/10.

**Overall Benchmark Score for "24_3"**: \( \frac{8 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 8}{7} \) ≈ 7.3/10.

### Analysis of "24_4" FSM

1. **State Coverage**: Similar to "24_3", but the link back to 'MONITOR_PLAY' from 'CALL_FOR_HELP' improves coverage. Score: 8.5/10.
2. **Transition Coverage**: Improved by linking 'CALL_FOR_HELP' back to 'MONITOR_PLAY', ensuring continuous monitoring. Score: 8/10.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Similar to "24_3", with a slightly better interconnectivity due to the improved loop. Score: 6.5/10.
4. **Safety Mindset**: Maintains a good focus on safety, similar to "24_3". Score: 8/10.
5. **Scalability**: Improved scalability due to the better loop structure, facilitating adaptability. Score: 7.5/10.
6. **Assistance UX**: Similar to "24_3", but the continuous monitoring loop offers a more natural interaction. Score: 7.5/10.
7. **Action Set Alignment**: Similar adherence to the action set vocabulary as "24_3". Score: 8/10.

**Overall Benchmark Score for "24_4"**: \( \frac{8.5 + 8 + 6.5 + 8 + 7.5 + 7.5 + 8}{7} \) ≈ 7.7/10.

### Comparison with "24_best" FSM

- "24_best" has a perfect 10 in all dimensions, showcasing a comprehensive, safety-oriented, and user-friendly FSM design.
- Both "24_3" and "24_4" score lower but show strengths in safety mindset and action set alignment.
- "24_4" shows slight improvements over "24_3", particularly in state and transition coverage, as well as scalability and UX.
- The primary areas for improvement for both "24_3" and "24_4" lie in increasing the complexity and scalability while maintaining a strong focus on safety and user experience.

In summary, while both "24_3" and "24_4" are robust in certain aspects, they fall short of the benchmark set by "24_best", particularly in terms of state coverage, transition coverage, and the overall complexity and scalability of the FSM.
