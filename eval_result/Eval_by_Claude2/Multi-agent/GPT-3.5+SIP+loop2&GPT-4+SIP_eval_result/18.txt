 Based on the details provided, here is my analysis of the FSMs:

For code 18_2:

State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers key states but does not have environmental monitoring or child safety validation states.

Transition Coverage: 9/10 - Has transitions from each state to likely next states. Only lacks loop back to assessing situation continuously.   

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10 - Some interconnectivity between states but quite linear in flow.

Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Actions indicate safety mindset but no validation of ensured child safety.

Scalability: 8/10 - Encapsulates key capabilities in states for extensibility. State transitions cover likely scenarios.

Assistance UX: 7/10 - Provides warnings and explanations to child for natural interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 7/10 - Uses some aligned actions like covering, moving child. But also has some custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.6/10


For code 18_3: 

State Coverage: 9/10 - Covers major states needed including assessing, engaging child and monitoring.

Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Defines transitions from each state. Lacks some minor cases.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Some interconnectivity between states. Could be further improved.

Safety Mindset: 9/10 - States focused on safety like covering outlet and monitoring risks.

Scalability: 8/10 - Breaks down capabilities into distinct states for extensibility.  

Assistance UX: 8/10 - Engages child with alternative toys fitting the situation.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Encoding uses aligned action verbs like checking, covering, monitoring.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.3/10

In summary, 18_3 performs better on state coverage, safety mindset and action alignment. But 18_2 has slightly more robust transitions. Both score reasonably well across most dimensions. But 18_3 has a higher overall benchmark score primarily by leveraging more capabilities relevant to this exact child safety scenario.
