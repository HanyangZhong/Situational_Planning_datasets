 Here is my analysis of the FSMs in code "22_2" and "22_3" based on the FSM and evaluation of "22_1":

Code "22_2" analysis:

1. State Coverage: Score = 8
   - Defines 7 states covering most situations, only missing explicit safety/security state

2. Transition Coverage: Score = 8 
   - Connects almost all states in logical sequences, no disconnected subgraphs

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Score = 6  
   - Moderately interconnected states with some redundancy 

4. Safety Mindset: Score = 7
   - Improves on "22_1" by checking condition, but still lacks proactive safety states

5. Scalability: Score = 7
   - Encapsulates complexity better than "22_1", but entanglement limits flexibility

6. Assistance UX: Score = 4
   - Attempts to provide comfort, but interactions still robotic vs human centric

7. Action Set Alignment: Score = 9
   - Leverages 6 benchmark actions (Checking, Reaching, Moving, Calling for help, Comforting, Monitoring)

Overall Benchmark Score = (8 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 4 + 9) / 7 = 7.0


Code "22_3" analysis:

1. State Coverage: Score = 9
   - Comprehensive states to fully handle assisting the woman  

2. Transition Coverage: Score = 9
   - Fully connected transitions between all states
   
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Score = 8
   - High interconnectivity between states, but not dense
   
4. Safety Mindset: Score = 8
   - Responds by pressing emergency button and monitoring woman

5. Scalability: Score = 8
   - Structure enables adding states/transitions to extend FSM

6. Assistance UX: Score = 6
   - Attempts personalized interactions but still somewhat rigid
   
7. Action Set Alignment: Score = 10
   - Strictly uses 6 benchmark actions (Checking, Reaching, Pressing, Monitoring, Calling for help)

Overall Benchmark Score = (9 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 10) / 7 = 8.4

In summary, "22_3" scores higher across most dimensions with stronger state coverage, transitions, scalability, action alignment, and a solid safety mindset. "22_2" better encapsulates complexity and provides additional actions, but has gaps in states and interactions.Tuning "22_2" to improve state coverage and assistance UX would help match "22_3".
