 Here are my ratings and analysis of the FSMs in the code contents:

Code 12_1 FSM:

1. State Coverage: 8. Covers key states for assessing, handling hazards, adjustments. No monitoring after changes.

2. Transition Coverage: 7. Decent coverage of likely sequences, but no transitions back to hazards from monitoring.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5. Reasonably modular without too much interconnection.

4. Safety Mindset: 9. Strong considerations for avoiding harm.

5. Scalability: 7. Good abstractions but some specific pregnancy references.

6. Assistance UX: 6. Functional assistance without personalization.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 8. Mostly uses defined actions, but some custom ones like "is_lighting_adjustment_needed".

Overall Benchmark Score = (8 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 7 + 6 + 8) / 7 = 7.0


Code 12_2 FSM:  

1. State Coverage: 9. Additional monitoring and navigation states provide more complete coverage.

2. Transition Coverage: 8. Includes transitions back to handling hazards and changes.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6. More interconnections between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 9. Same considerations for safety.  

5. Scalability: 8. Improved by adding more modular states.

6. Assistance UX: 7. Additional navigation assistance is more helpful.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9. Uses strictly defined action set other than "checking".

Overall Benchmark Score = (9 + 8 + 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 9) / 7 = 8.0


Code 12_3 FSM:   

1. State Coverage: 5. Only covers cleaning and monitoring states. Major gaps for navigation, lighting, etc.  

2. Transition Coverage: 3. Very linear transitions that do not cover likely sequences well.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2. Minimal interconnections between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7. Considers some hazard avoidance but not navigation.  

5. Scalability: 4. Tightly coupled to cleaning scenario assumptions.

6. Assistance UX: 3. No real-time occupant assistance provided.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5. Uses some defined actions like checking, but many customized cleaning verbs instead.

Overall Benchmark Score = (5 + 3 + 2 + 7 + 4 + 3 + 5) / 7 = 4.3

In summary, the code 12_2 FSM is the strongest overall by adding important states and transitions while aligning actions cleanly. Code 12_1 establishes the baseline of key capabilities. Code 12_3 focuses narrowly on cleaning rather than the full situation, hurting its coverage, transitions, scalability and assistance levels compared to the other FSMs.
