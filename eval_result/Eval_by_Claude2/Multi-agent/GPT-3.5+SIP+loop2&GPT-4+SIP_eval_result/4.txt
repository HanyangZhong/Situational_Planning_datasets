 Here is my analysis of the three FSMs:

For code "4_2":

State Coverage: 8/10 
Covers key states but does not includeexplicit states for mitigating the stove directly or checking the final resolution.

Transition Coverage: 8/10
Adds logical transitions including additional steps when unsafe states recur. Does not cover transition back to assessing if help resolves issue.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10  
Interconnectivity is moderately high. Each state links to 2-4 others.

Safety Mindset: 9/10
The additional states enhance safety by checking secure conditions. But mitigating stove risk directly could improve.

Scalability: 8/10
Encapsulates complexity decently. New context would require adding states and annotation methods.

Assistance UX: 7/10  
Better language and personalization. Still some rigid interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10
Broadly aligns to the standard action set vocabulary. Minor customizations like "change".

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.0/10


For code "4_3": 

State Coverage: 7/10
Covers key states, but lacks transitions for reiterating hazard removal, resolving issues, or final checking.

Transition Coverage: 5/10 
Minimal transitions that purely sequence states. No contingency paths based on recurring unsafe observations.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10
Strict linear sequences of states. No flexibility or contingencies.

Safety Mindset: 7/10 
Focuses on hazard removal but no mechanisms to handle recurring dangers.

Scalability: 5/10
Hardcoded sequences resist modification. Does not encapsulate complexity.

Assistance UX: 4/10
No natural language or personalization.

Action Set Alignment: 10/10
Exclusively uses actions from standard vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0/10


In summary, "4_2" better encapsulates complexity with its state coverage, transitions, and annotation methods. But "4_3" strictly sticks to the standard action vocabulary. Both could improve safety considerations and human-centric UX. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
