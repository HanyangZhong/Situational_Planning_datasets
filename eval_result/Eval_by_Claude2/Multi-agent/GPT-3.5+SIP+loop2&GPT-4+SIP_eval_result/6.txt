 Here is my analysis of the FSMs compared to the benchmark "6_1":

For "6_2":

State Coverage: 9/10 - Adds spill cleanup and hazard verification states.

Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Improves coverage of likely sequences.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Somewhat more interconnectivity between states.  

Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Explicitly verifies hazard elimination.

Scalability: 7/10 - Separates some state responsibilities but still entangled.

Assistance UX: 5/10 - No change from benchmark.

Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses defined actions, introduces "mopping".

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.4/10


For "6_3":

State Coverage: 7/10 - Covers key states but lacks depth in some areas.

Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Decent connections but some gaps.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Fairly linear structure.

Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Prioritizes cleaning up hazards.  

Scalability: 6/10 - Separates high-level states but tightly coupled.

Assistance UX: 4/10 - Very basic interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 5/10 - Mix of defined and custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0/10


In summary, "6_2" better addresses state coverage, transitions, safety verification, and improves alignment to the action vocabulary. But it retains some entanglement across states.

"6_3" covers key scenarios and promotes safety, but lacks transitions in some areas and uses more custom actions. Both have room for improvement in expanding interactions.
