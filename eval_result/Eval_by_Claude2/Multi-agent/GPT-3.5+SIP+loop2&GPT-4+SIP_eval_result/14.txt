 Based on the details provided, here is an analysis of the FSMs in code content "14_2" and "14_3" compared to "14_1":

For "14_2":

State Coverage: 8/10
Adds states to remove hazards and distract cat, but still lacks monitoring after helping cat.

Transition Coverage: 8/10  
Has more transitions including assess to remove hazards to distract cat. But lacks transitions back to monitoring.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10
Slightly more interconnected with cat on/off counter tied to remove hazards and distract cat.

Safety Mindset: 8/10
Focus on removing hazards and distracting cat is safety oriented.

Scalability: 8/10
Reasonably encapsulated to allow additional contexts to be added.

Assistance UX: 7/10  
Added more positive interactions to help cat, but still quite basic.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10
Leverages removing, distracting, calling, and monitoring actions well.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.9/10


For "14_3":

State Coverage: 9/10
Covers key states of assessing, removing hazards, distracting cat, monitoring, and calling for help.

Transition Coverage: 8/10
Has good connections between states, but lacks transitions back to monitoring from calling for help.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 
More interconnections between assess, remove, distract, monitor states.

Safety Mindset: 9/10
Strong focus on removing hazards, distracting cat, and monitoring for safety.

Scalability: 9/10
Clean encapsulation of states to enable extending context.

Assistance UX: 8/10
Proactively helps cat and continues monitoring, residing interactions. 

Action Set Alignment: 10/10
FSM composes overall behavior strictly using the actions provided in the benchmark set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.6/10

The HFSM in "14_3" scores higher overall by proactively monitoring safety with tightly scoped behaviors from the action benchmark set. The additional states and transitions also increase coverage and interconnectedness. The assistive experience is more context aware as well.
