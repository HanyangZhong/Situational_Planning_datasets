 Here is my analysis of the FSMs:

FSM 21_2:

1. State Coverage: 8. Covers key states like assessing situation, retrieving wheelchair, reaching button, providing assistance, assessing injuries, getting help. But does not cover states for moving person back to wheelchair.  

2. Transition Coverage: 7. Has good coverage of likely transitions between states. But lacks transitions from wait state to resume monitoring after help arrives.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4. Some interconnections between states like injuries leading to assessments. But overall still linear in structure.  

4. Safety Mindset: 9. Prioritizes safety by checking for injuries, calling for help when needed. But lacks safety check after help arrives.

5. Scalability: 7. Additional states can be inserted as needed. But transitions may get complex with scale.

6. Assistance UX: 6. Has basic print statements for interactions. Can be made more natural with dialogues.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9. Leverages vocabulary well with checking, calling for help, monitoring etc. Only uses generic print statements.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8

FSM 21_3: 

1. State Coverage: 6. Covers evaluating situation, reaching button, calling for help. But lacks detailed assistance states.

2. Transition Coverage: 5. Basic linear flow from evaluating situation to calling for help. Lacks contingency management.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3. Strict linear flow with no bifurcations or interconnections between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7. Focuses on reaching button and calling for help. But lacks ongoing assessments.  

5. Scalability: 8. Simple structure makes adding new states easier without disrupting flow.

6. Assistance UX: 7. Uses domain vocabulary for actions which feels more natural.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9. Leverages action set well for reaching, checking, calling for help. Minimal custom actions. 

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4

In summary, FSM 21_2 has more complete coverage of necessary states and transitions compared to FSM 21_3. It also prioritizes safety better with injury assessments and help calls. However, FSM 21_3 is easier to scale up due to simpler state transitions. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
