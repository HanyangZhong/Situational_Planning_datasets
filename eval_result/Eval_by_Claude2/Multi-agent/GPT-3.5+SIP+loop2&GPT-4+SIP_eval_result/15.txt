 Based on the details provided, here is my analysis of the FSMs:

For code "15_2":

State Coverage: 8/10 
- Adds key states missing from 15_1 like distracting cat, getting help.
- No state for notifying owners of actions taken.

Transition Coverage: 7/10
- Has conditional transitions based on cat status.
- Transitions cover likely sequences.
- Could be further extended.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10
- Increased interconnectivity between states.
- But overall complexity still quite linear. 

Safety Mindset: 8/10
Safety remains a priority, but could do more explicit safety checks.

Scalability: 6/10  
- Encapsulates states/actions better than 15_1.
- But states themselves not very modular.

Assistance UX: 5/10
- Added helpful states like distracting cat.
- But interactions still lack personalization.

Action Set Alignment: 7/10 
- Leverages standard actions appropriately.
- But also uses some custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4/10


For code "15_3":

State Coverage: 7/10
- Key states for assessing and mitigating hazards.
- No states for getting help, notifying owners. 

Transition Coverage: 6/10 
- Logical hazard-based transitions.
- Lacks transitions for help, notifications.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10
Mostly linear transitions focused on hazards.

Safety Mindset: 9/10
Strong focus on identifying and fixing hazards.  

Scalability: 7/10
Encapsulates hazard handling into states nicely.
But overall less modular than ideal.

Assistance UX: 4/10
Very functional, no personalization.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10
Excellent leverage of standard actions. 

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3/10
