 Here is my analysis and scoring of the FSMs:

For code "5_2":

State Coverage: 9/10 
- Added missing safety verification state

Transition Coverage: 8/10
- Improved coverage of potential spill cleanup loops  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10
- Slightly more interconnectivity between states

Safety Mindset: 10/10 
- Additional safety checks before monitoring state

Scalability: 8/10
- More encapsulated with ensure safety state

Assistance UX: 6/10
- Added some nuance with safety checks

Action Set Alignment: 9/10
- Used standard actions, customized only one

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.0/10


For code "5_3":

State Coverage: 7/10
- Covers key states but misses some nuances

Transition Coverage: 6/10
- Decent transitions but lacks spill handling 

Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10
- Mostly linear transitions

Safety Mindset: 8/10
- Focuses on securing hazards

Scalability: 5/10
- Tightly coupled to medication scenario

Assistance UX: 6/10  
- Attempts some personalization 

Action Set Alignment: 5/10
- Uses several non-standard actions

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0/10


In summary, the FSM in code "5_2" has better coverage of states and transitions, with added safety verification and scalability. It aligns closely to the standard action set.

The FSM in code "5_3" handles key states but lacks complexity and scalability. It introduces more custom actions outside the standard vocabulary.
