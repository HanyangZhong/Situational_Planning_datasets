 Here is my analysis of the FSMs based on the provided scoring dimensions:

FSM in Code 8_2:

1. State Coverage: Score = 8
   - Covers key states and adds 'CALL_FOR_HELP' and 'MONITOR' for increased robustness

2. Transition Coverage: Score = 7 
   - Adds transitions from 'CLEANUP' to 'MONITOR' for continuous monitoring 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Score = 3
   - Remains relatively linear with additional states/transitions

4. Safety Mindset: Score = 8
   - Monitoring and calling for help improve safety mindset

5. Scalability: Score = 5
   - Additional states make it slightly harder to extend to wildly different contexts

6. Assistance UX: Score = 3
   - Still very simple printed output with no personalization 

7. Action Set Alignment: Score = 9
   - Aligns closely with action set, new states use common actions

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4


FSM in Code 8_3:

1. State Coverage: Score = 7
   - Covers key states, but lacks lower level detail 

2. Transition Coverage: Score = 6
   - Decent transitions between high-level states

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Score = 2 
   - Hierarchical nature keeps overall complexity low

4. Safety Mindset: Score = 9
   - Securing knives state directly prevents harm
   
5. Scalability: Score = 8
   - Hierarchical encapsulation eases extensions 

6. Assistance UX: Score = 4
   - Annotations allude to more natural interactions
   
7. Action Set Alignment: Score = 10
   - Strictly sticks to provided action set vocabulary

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

In summary, the FSM in Code 8_2 adds helpful states and transitions compared to Code 8_1 but has slightly lower scalability. The hierarchical FSM in Code 8_3 aligns very closely with the action set and has good safety mindset, but may lack details. The overall benchmark scores are fairly close.
