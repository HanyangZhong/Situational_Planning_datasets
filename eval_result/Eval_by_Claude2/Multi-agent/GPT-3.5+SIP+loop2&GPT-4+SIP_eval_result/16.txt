 Here is my analysis of the FSMs in code "16_2" and "16_3" based on the example FSM and evaluation provided for "16_1":

Code "16_2" Analysis:

Dimensions:
1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Adds a missing 'MONITOR_CHILD' state for ongoing safety checks.

2. Transition Coverage: 8/10 - The added state improves connectivity.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10 - Slightly more complex with new state.

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Monitoring child state further improves safety.

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Good encapsulation supports extensions.  

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Interactions seem functional but still directive.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3/10 - Uses same unaligned custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7/10


Code "16_3" Analysis:

Dimensions:
1. State Coverage: 9/10 - Covers key states of assessing, mitigating risks, engaging child.

2. Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Main pathways covered, lacks some minor branches.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Medium complexity with 5 key states.

4. Safety Mindset: 10/10 - Clear focus on proactive safety.

5. Scalability: 8/10 - States encapsulate distinct functions.

6. Assistance UX: 8/10 - More natural engagement via toys, rules.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5/10 - Uses some benchmark actions but also custom ones. 

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.1/10

Summary:
Code 16_2 improves state coverage and safety from baseline 16_1 through added monitoring. Code 16_3 is more proactive on safety and has natural UX. Both score higher overall but lag on action alignment. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
