 Here is my analysis of the FSMs in the code "24_2" and "24_3" against the benchmark "24_1":

Code 24_2:

State Coverage: 8/10 
Covers the same key states as 24_1. The idle state still seems redundant.

Transition Coverage: 8/10
Connectivity improved from 24_1 by linking call for help back to monitoring play rather than idle. 

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10
No change in complexity from 24_1. States remain moderately interconnected.

Safety Mindset: 9/10
Still prioritizes safety very well, including changes to reconnect call for help.

Scalability: 7/10  
No major change in modularity from 24_1. Still somewhat entangled but reasonable.

Assistance UX: 6/10
No real improvement over 24_1. Interactions are still robotic without personalization. 

Action Set Alignment: 9/10
Custom choke hazard check removed, now uses vocabulary actions like checking, calling, instructing. Much better alignment.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.6/10

The updated FSM in 24_2 makes good incremental improvements over 24_1, especially in connectivity and action alignment. Safety focus remains strong.


Code 24_3:

State Coverage: 9/10
Very comprehensive coverage of key states like assessing situation, removing dangers, engaging child, monitoring play.

Transition Coverage: 8/10
Connectivity captures likely sequences well. Only issue is linking call for help back to initial rather than monitoring play.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 
Moderate interconnectivity between monitor play, engage child, and remove danger states. Other states more standalone.

Safety Mindset: 10/10
Extremely safety-focused throughout all states and transitions. Top score.  

Scalability: 8/10  
Good modularity in most states. Some entanglement still between engage, monitor and remove danger states.

Assistance UX: 8/10 
Fairly strong situational awareness and child engagement interactions. Much more natural than 24_1 and 24_2.

Action Set Alignment: 10/10
Excellent compliance with defined action vocabulary like checking, gripping, delivering, calling. No custom actions. 

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.6/10

The FSM design in 24_3 is very strong, with a clear focus on safety and compliance with standard actions. State coverage is excellent and connectivity reasonable. It should perform well in assisting the child.
