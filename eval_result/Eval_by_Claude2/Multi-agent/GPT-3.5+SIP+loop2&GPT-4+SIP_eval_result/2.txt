 Here is my analysis of the FSMs in code "2_2" and "2_3" compared to the benchmark FSM in code "2_1":

Code "2_2" FSM:

State Coverage: 8/10
Adds a "CALL_FOR_HELP" state to cover getting human assistance when needed. Other key states from "2_1" are included.

Transition Coverage: 9/10 
Builds on "2_1" transitions with the new help state and transitions back from "MONITOR". Slightly more interconnected.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10
A bit more complex with the additional state and transitions, but overall connectivity remains moderately simple.

Safety Mindset: 9/10  
Introduction of calling for help improves handling of safety risks. Spill assessment and cleaning states still central.

Scalability: 7/10
Framework extends well to new hazards with the help state, but still centered around spill scenarios.

Assistance UX: 6/10 
Adds helpful calling behavior but lacks nuance in human interactions. Experience remains fairly rigid.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10
Strictly conforms to action vocabulary except for one new "call" action in call for help state. Very aligned overall.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.4/10


Code "2_3" FSM:

State Coverage: 8/10
Covers hazard recognition, spill cleanup, stove safety and monitoring. Additional utility states could improve coverage.

Transition Coverage: 7/10
Logically connects the defined states, but lacks fallback transitions to key states limiting flexibility. 

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10  
Relatively linear state transitions, marginal interconnectivity between states.

Safety Mindset: 9/10
Handling spills, stove hazards, and continuous monitoring show strong safety considerations.

Scalability: 7/10
States are hazarded focused, supporting extensibility. But specificity to kitchen limits reusability.  

Assistance UX: 4/10
Minimal states provide functional assistance but lack personalized interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 10/10 
Excellent conformance to established action vocabulary throughout all encoded behaviors.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.0/10

The FSM takes a safe approach focused on kitchen hazards. Alignment to action vocabulary is excellent but UX and complexity could improve. Balance of strengths and weaknesses.
