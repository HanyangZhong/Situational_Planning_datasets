 Here are my analysis and scores of the FSMs in code "10_2" and "10_3" against the benchmark "10_1":

Code "10_2" analysis:

State Coverage: 8/10
Covers the key states, added a "CALL_FOR_HELP" state to handle contingencies. Lacks customization for the user. 

Transition Coverage: 9/10
Good transitions covering success and failure scenarios. Only lacks transitions to recover from help call.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10  
Slightly more interconnected with the added help state. But overall still moderate.

Safety Mindset: 9/10
Significant safety improvements by checking action outcomes. Help call also improves safety.

Scalability: 8/10
Encapsulation is still good for extension.

Assistance UX: 6/10 
Interaction is functional but lacks personalization.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10
Strictly uses actions from standard vocabulary, except "print" statements.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.0/10


Code "10_3" analysis:

State Coverage: 9/10
Covers almost all necessary states. Could add customization.

Transition Coverage: 8/10
Handles key transitions well. Could improve failure handling.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10
Moderately interconnected between states.

Safety Mindset: 9/10 
Monitors situation and calls for help when needed.

Scalability: 7/10
Some entanglement between states.

Assistance UX: 7/10
Interaction is reasonably natural.

Action Set Alignment: 10/10
Strictly follows action set vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.1/10


In summary, both FSMs have improved over the original with more safety mechanisms and failure handling. Code "10_3" edges out with slightly better overall score by more thoroughly covering necessary states and transitions for the scenario. But both are now solid FSM implementations for assisting the wheelchair user.
