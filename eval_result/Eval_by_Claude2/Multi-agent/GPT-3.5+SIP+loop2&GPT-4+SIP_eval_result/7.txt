 Here are my detailed analyses and scores for the FSMs:

Code 7_1:

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers key states but lacks explicit handling of staircase hazard

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Decent connectivity between states but some gaps in transitions

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Multiple states link to evaluate_items, creating dense interconnectivity 

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Clear priority on safety with monitoring and calling for help

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Fairly modular structure makes adding states/behaviors reasonable

6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - Interactions OK but lack personalization and context-awareness  

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Most actions align but a few custom ones like perform_initial_assessment()

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.4/10


Code 7_2: 

1. State Coverage: 9/10 - Added staircase navigation state to improve coverage

2. Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Connectivity enhances safety by reassessing after actions  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10 - Some reduction by eliminating evaluate hub state

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Assessing situation repeatedly to maintain safety

5. Scalability: 8/10 - More modular by encapsulating states into distinct functions

6. Assistance UX: 7/10 - Added ability to assist with items helps experience  

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Leveraged standard vocabulary for assisting, navigating 

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.1/10


Code 7_3:

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Covers major states but omits details like lamp placement  

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Strict linear sequence lacks flexibility 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Simplistic linear structure without branches  

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Focuses mostly on clearing clutter

5. Scalability: 8/10 - Easy to insert new linear states as needed

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - No interactivity or context-awareness  

7. Action Set Alignment: 6/10 - Uses some key verbs but also vague "cleaning"  

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.9/10

The biggest issue is the fixed linear sequence, creating transition coverage and complexity limitations. Enhancing flexibility and interactivity would significantly improve the benchmark.
