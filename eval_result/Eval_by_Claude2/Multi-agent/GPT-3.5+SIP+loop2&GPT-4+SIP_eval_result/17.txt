 Here is my analysis of the FSMs in the provided code:

For "17_1":

State Coverage: 5/10
Defines 5 core states but lacks states for stair gate detection, engaging child, etc.

Transition Coverage: 3/10
Minimal transitions between states. No transitions for handling child once detected. 

Cyclomatic Complexity: 2/10  
Each state only transitions to one other state indicating low interconnectivity.

Safety Mindset: 2/10
No specific mechanism for ensuring child safety.

Scalability: 4/10
Core structure is extendable but lacks child safety mechanisms.

Assistance UX: 1/10
Very simplistic interaction flow.

Action Set Alignment: 2/10
Utilizes 2 actions (Calling, Checking) from the defined set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 2.4/10
Does not perform well on safety and UX. Limited coverage and transitions.

For "17_2":

State Coverage: 8/10
Covers key states though lacks mechanisms for physically securing child.  

Transition Coverage: 7/10
Handles multiple branches for ensuring safety. No transitions for physically securing child.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10
Increased interconnectivity between states.

Safety Mindset: 8/10
Explicit states for ensuring child safety.  

Scalability: 7/10
Extensible structure for addressing child safety.

Assistance UX: 5/10  
Improved from "17_1" but still relatively simplistic interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 3/10   
Utilizes 3 actions (Calling, Checking, Securing) from the defined set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3/10
Significantly improved from "17_1" on safety and coverage aspects. Still lacks physical child handling capability.

For "17_3":

State Coverage: 7/10
Covers monitoring and distraction but no inherent ability to physically secure child.

Transition Coverage: 6/10 
Handles monitoring and distraction branches.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10
Some interconnectivity between states.  

Safety Mindset: 6/10
Explicit handling for distraction but no physical safeguarding. 

Scalability: 5/10
Structure is extendable to related safety scenarios.

Assistance UX: 4/10
Improved interactions compared to "17_1" but still limited.  

Action Set Alignment: 7/10
Leverages 7 actions from the defined vocabulary set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.4/10  
Better alignment to action set. Lacks native capability to physically secure child from harm.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional codes to analyze on these metrics!
