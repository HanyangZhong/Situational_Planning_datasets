 Here are the analysis and scores for the three FSMs based on the provided dimensions:

FSM in Code 3_1:

State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers key states like assessing situation, taking actions on candle, finishing but lacks explicit states for verifying success or calling for help.  

Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Models likely sequences but does not cover all scenarios like retrying if fire is not extinguished.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Progresses linearly once an action is taken with some interconnectivity between states.

Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Prioritizes removing or covering candle but does not verify the fire hazard is addressed.  

Scalability: 6/10 - Reasonably encapsulated but significant changes needed for additional context.

Assistance UX: 5/10 - Functional interaction but not adaptive or personalized.  

Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Mostly uses provided action set vocabulary except ``print`` statements.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7/10**


FSM in Code 3_2:

State Coverage: 9/10 - Added states for verifying success and calling for help.

Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Handles cases like fire not extinguished in first attempt.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Some interconnectivity between states based on conditions.

Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Verifies fire is extinguished and calls for help if not.

Scalability: 7/10 - Additional states make extensions easier.

Assistance UX: 6/10 - Added success verification but could be more adaptive.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Strictly uses action set except ``print`` statements.  

**Overall Benchmark Score: 8/10**


FSM in Code 3_3:

State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers key states but does not verify end conditions are met.

Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Models likely sequences based on assessments.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10 - Branches based on assessments but mostly linear.

Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Prioritizes extinguishing flame.

Scalability: 7/10 - Reasonably encapsulated for extensions.

Assistance UX: 7/10 - Assessments enable some adaptivity. 

Action Set Alignment: 5/10 - Introduces many custom actions not in benchmark list.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 7/10**

In summary, the FSM in Code 3_2 addresses the gaps from Code 3_1 and scores the highest at 8/10. The FSM in Code 3_3 also makes improvements but alignment to the action set needs improvement. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
