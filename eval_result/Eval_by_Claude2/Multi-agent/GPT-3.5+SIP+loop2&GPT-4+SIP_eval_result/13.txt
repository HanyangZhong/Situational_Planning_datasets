 Here is my analysis of the FSMs:

For code 13_2:

State Coverage: 9/10 - Covers the key states but lacks a final resolved state.

Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Good connectivity between states but no clear termination.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Reasonably modular but quite interconnected.

Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Continually monitors for hazards.

Scalability: 7/10 - Additional states would require refactoring transitions.

Assistance UX: 7/10 - Attempts personalization but still somewhat robotic. 

Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Mostly aligns with some minor deviations.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.0/10


For code 13_3:

State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers primary states but lacks nuanced transitions.

Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Linear sequence of states without branching.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Strictly linear from start to end.

Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Removes hazard but doesn't continue monitoring.  

Scalability: 5/10 - Hard to extend without refactoring structure.

Assistance UX: 7/10 - Clear but robotic communication.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Precisely matches action vocabulary.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3/10

In summary, code 13_2 better handles ongoing monitoring and assessment with more complete state coverage and transitions, as well as better scalability and assistance experience. However it deviates slightly more from the standard action set. Code 13_3 directly implements the actions but has a more linear structure without ongoing safety assessments.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate or provide more details on any part of this analysis. I'm happy to go into more depth on the scoring and comparisons between these FSMs.
