 Here is my analysis and scoring of the FSMs:

FSM 1_1:
State Coverage: 10/10 - Covers all necessary states to handle the bathroom scene
Transition Coverage: 9/10 - Mostly complete transitions between states
Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Some interconnectivity between states
Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Checks for hazards and cleans spills
Scalability: 9/10 - Cohesive states enable extensions
Assistance UX: 7/10 - Mostly task-focused interactions  
Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Aligns well but introduces 2 custom actions

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.4/10


FSM 1_2:  
State Coverage: 10/10 - Added checks make it very thorough
Transition Coverage: 10/10 - Closed loop transitions are complete 
Cyclomatic Complexity: 8/10 - Increased branches   
Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Additional verification state
Scalability: 9/10 - Still modular
Assistance UX: 7/10 - No improvement  
Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - No change

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.9/10


FSM 1_3:
State Coverage: 8/10 - Lacks finish state  
Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Linear transitions  
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Simplistic interconnectivity
Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Includes monitoring  
Scalability: 7/10 - Not very modular
Assistance UX: 6/10 - Task focused  
Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Aligns well

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.3/10

In summary, FSM 1_2 improves monitoring and verification over 1_1, with higher complexity and benchmark score. FSM 1_3 focuses more on safety but lacks transitions and scalability compared to the others. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
