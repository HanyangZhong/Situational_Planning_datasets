 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided:

FSM 1_1:
1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers most necessary states, but is missing an explicit state to check shower closure and defog mirror.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Has logical state transitions, but no feedback loops to reassess situation.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Fairly linear state transitions from start to finish.
4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Handles wet floor, but does not explicitly check for other hazards.
5. Scalability: 5 - Structure is rigid, additional states would require overhaul.
6. Assistance UX: 7 - Functional assistance, but interactions seem robotic. 
7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Uses alignment actions like mopping, wiping, arranging.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

FSM 1_2:
1. State Coverage: 7 - Checks major issues, but does not cover all required states.
2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Transitions back to assess state after actions, but structured as subnets.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Fairly linear flow from checking to actions and back.  
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Explicitly handles wet floor and other safety issues.
5. Scalability: 4 - Structure with disconnected subnets would require significant changes to extend.
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, but task-driven interactions lack personalization.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses many expected actions, introduces some new ones like scrubbing.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7

FSM 1_3:
1. State Coverage: 8 - Checks and handles major bathroom elements, minor gaps.  
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Reassesses after actions, but has independent state branches.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Increased interconnectivity between some states.
4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Considers multiple safety hazards in environment. 
5. Scalability: 7 - Clear encapsulation eases extending new states if required.
6. Assistance UX: 8 - Explicit check and handle structure feels natural.
7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Closely aligns actions to expected vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.9

FSM 1_4:
1. State Coverage: 5 - Covers only cleaning tasks, lacks assessment and final checks.
2. Transition Coverage: 3 - Very linear structure with no feedback or interconnectedness.  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 1 - Purely linear transitions from initial state to completion.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Handles floor and displaced items, but no ongoing checks.
5. Scalability: 4 - Hard to extend without disrupting overall flow. 
6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very functional flow, but task list style interaction.
7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Uses aligned actions for cleaning tasks.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3 

FSM 1_5:
1. State Coverage: 7 - Checks major elements, does not cover closing shower explicitly.  
2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Has assessment feedback, but structured as separate paths. 
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Linear flow within checking and handling branches.
4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Checks and handles water spillage issues.
5. Scalability: 6 - Additional branches can augment existing structure.  
6. Assistance UX: 7 - Clear cue words for actions, but sounds programmed. 
7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Uses vocabulary with minor additions like entering.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.6

FSM 1_6:  
1. State Coverage: 6 - Covers handling of mat, towel, and curtain but misses checks.
2. Transition Coverage: 3 - Sequential execution from initialize state to completion.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 1 - Pure linear state transitions.
4. Safety Mindset: 5 - Closes curtain but does not check other hazards.  
5. Scalability: 7 - Additional states can be inserted cleanly.
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Instructions seem memorized and robotic.  
7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Uses prescribed action vocabulary.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7

In summary, FSM 1_3 has the highest overall benchmark score of 7.9. It has good state coverage, safety mindset and scalability. FSMs 1_5 and 1_1 also score reasonably well. The lowest scores belong to FSMs 1_4 and 1_6 due to their linear structures. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
