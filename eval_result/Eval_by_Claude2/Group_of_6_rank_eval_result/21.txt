 Here are my analyses and scores for the FSMs:

FSM 21_1:
1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like checking situation, reaching/pressing button, calling for help. No state for providing interim help.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Reasonably well connected but no transitions once help called.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Simple linear transitions from one state to next.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to help person but no monitoring after call. 
5. Scalability: 8 - Additional states can be inserted easily.
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very robotic, functional interactions.
7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses some defined actions like monitoring, checking, extending arm but also introduces new actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0

FSM 21_2: 
1. State Coverage: 6 - Checks situation and calls for help but no intermediate assistance.
2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Transitions only in one direction.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Very linear.
4. Safety Mindset: 5 - Provides minimal safety assistance.
5. Scalability: 7 - Simple structure makes adding new states easier.  
6. Assistance UX: 4 - Basic, no personalization.
7. Action Set Alignment: 2 - Few selected actions, many custom.

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.4

FSM 21_3:
1. State Coverage: 7 - Covers help and monitoring but misses some in-between.
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Reasonably connected states.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Linear flow from one state to next.  
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to provide safety but no monitoring.
5. Scalability: 8 - Additional states can plug in easily.
6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very functional interactions.
7. Action Set Alignment: 1 - Uses almost no defined actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.0

FSM 21_4:  
1. State Coverage: 7 - Checks on person and calls for help.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Connects states reasonably well.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Linear transitions.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Ensures help for person.
5. Scalability: 8 - Modular structure makes extensions easier.
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Functional.  
7. Action Set Alignment: 4 - Uses some defined actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0

FSM 21_5:
1. State Coverage: 8 - Assesses, helps, and monitors person.  
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Reasonably connected states.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Linear flow.
4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Continuously checks on person.
5. Scalability: 7 - Some entanglement but organized.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Provides some comfort.
7. Action Set Alignment: 2 - Mostly custom actions.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7

FSM 21_6:  
1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers assessment through monitoring.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Connects states in sequence.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Strict linear flow.  
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Ensures help arrives. 
5. Scalability: 8 - Easy to insert new states.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Some personalization.  
7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Few defined actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.9
