 Here are my analysis and scores for the FSMs:

FSM 13_1:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers most necessary states but lacks any monitoring or calling for help states.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Transitions generally cover likely sequences but no contingency plans if actions fail.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Simple linear state transitions with no branching.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes securing chemicals which helps safety. But no ongoing monitoring.

5. Scalability: 4 - Specific to only this exact scenario with no flexibility built in.

6. Assistance UX: 3 - Very robotic interactions with the woman.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Most actions are from standard vocabulary but uses some custom actions like "transporting".

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7

FSM 13_2: 

1. State Coverage: 9 - Contains states to handle all key aspects of the scenario.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Robust connections between states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Some branching depending on air quality checks.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Ongoing monitoring and help calling improves safety.

5. Scalability: 7 - Mechanisms to extend to other environments.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Decent interactions with occupant.

7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Uses predefined action set vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.9

FSM 13_3:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Key states for full situation coverage.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Generally good connections between states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Linear state transitions. 

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Removes hazard then monitors after.

5. Scalability: 6 -Some flexibility to extend behavior.

6. Assistance UX: 8 - Natural communication with occupant.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Aligns well with standard actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.0

FSM 13_4: 

1. State Coverage: 5 - Only covers a narrow aspect of the scenario.

2. Transition Coverage: 3 - Very limited transitions.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 1 - Strict linear structure.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Attempts to mitigate immediate risk.

5. Scalability: 3 - Hardcoded to specifics of this kitchen.

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very basic interaction.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Generally uses standard actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.3

FSM 13_5:

1. State Coverage: 7 - Defines states to handle primary risk.

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Covers key sequences.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Linear state machine.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Seeks to lower risk.

5. Scalability: 5 - Some ability to extend behavior.   

6. Assistance UX: 3 - Minimal occupant interaction.

7. Action Set Alignment: 10 - Uses formal action vocabulary.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0

FSM 13_6:  

1. State Coverage: 8 - Broad state coverage.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Robust connections between states.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Generally linear transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Mitigates and monitors risks.

5. Scalability: 6 - Some flexibility built in.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Decent occupant interactions.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 4 - Uses mostly custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.1

In summary, FSM 13_2 scores the highest at 7.9, followed by 13_3 and 13_6. FSM 13_4 scores the lowest at 4.3 due to significant gaps. The overall benchmark scores provide a quantitative comparison across key dimensions to precisely evaluate assistance quality. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
