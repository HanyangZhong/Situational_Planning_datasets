 Here are my analysis and scores for each FSM code:

**Code 20_1:**

State Coverage: 8 - Covers most key states like assess, retrieve device, call for help. Does not have states for continued monitoring or waiting for help.  

Transition Coverage: 7 - Has good connections between states, but no fallback transitions if certain states fail.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear flow from one state to next. Not much interconnectivity between states.  

Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to call for help once situation assessed. But lacks fallbacks.

Scalability: 8 - Structure is separated well, additional states can be added.

Assistance UX: 6 - Very functional, but not personalized or contextual interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses 16 verbs from defined list including Reaching, Grasping, Lowering, Pressing, and Calling.

**Overall Score: 7.0**

**Code 20_2:** 

State Coverage: 8 - Has key states to monitor, retrieve device, activate device and call for help. Additional states possible.

Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions, but lacks fallbacks if states fail.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Very linear single path through states.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to activate device and call for help.

Scalability: 8 - Structure is separated to allow extensions.

Assistance UX: 5 - Purely functional.

Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages 14 verbs from standard list.

**Overall Score: 6.7**


**Code 20_3:**

State Coverage: 9 - Has states to cover distress assessment, taking action, emergencies. Monitors throughout.

Transition Coverage: 8 - Good connections between states. Allows going to call for help from multiple states.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Some interconnectivity like returning to assess after calling for help.

Safety Mindset: 9 - Monitors throughout, calls for help if emergency.  

Scalability: 8 - Structure supports adding complexity.

Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional.

Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses 10 verbs from action list.

**Overall Score: 7.7**


**Code 20_4:**

State Coverage: 9 - Covers assessment, reaching device, assisting elderly, calling for help. Monitors initially.  

Transition Coverage: 8 - Allows transitions from multiple states to calling for help and monitoring.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Some interconnectivity between states.

Safety Mindset: 9 - Calls for help after assisting person.

Scalability: 7 - Some entanglement in assess situation logic.

Assistance UX: 4 - Very simplistic.

Action Set Alignment: 5 - Uses only 6 verbs from standard action list.

**Overall Score: 7.1**

**Code 20_5:**

State Coverage: 7 - Covers key states, but lacks sustained monitoring and human assistance. 

Transition Coverage: 6 - Has transitions between states, but lacks complexity or fallbacks.
 
Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very linear single path structure.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Attempts to call emergency services if needed.  

Scalability: 7 - Structure supports additional states if needed.

Assistance UX: 5 - Basic functional interactions only.

Action Set Alignment: 5 - Leverages 6 verbs from action list. 

**Overall Score: 5.7**


**Code 20_6:**

State Coverage: 5 - Only covers assessment, retrieving device and monitoring. Major gaps.

Transition Coverage: 4 - Transitions between a few states, lacks complexity.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Purely linear structure. 

Safety Mindset: 5 - Tries to retrieve device but limits assistance. 

Scalability: 7 - Simple structure could enable extensions.

Assistance UX: 3 - Extremely basic.

Action Set Alignment: 4 - Uses 4 verbs from standard action list.

**Overall Score: 4.4**
