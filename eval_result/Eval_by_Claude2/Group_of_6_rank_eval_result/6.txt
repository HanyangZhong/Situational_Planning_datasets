 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided relative to the example "6_best" FSM on the key dimensions:

FSM 6_1:
State Coverage: 8 - Covers main states but lacks detail in some areas 
Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions but some gaps in edge cases
Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Fairly simple unconditional transitions 
Safety Mindset: 7 - Attempts to address hazards but not comprehensive
Scalability: 6 - Structure helps but state specifics limit flexibility
Assistance UX: 5 - Somewhat robotic, simple assistance interactions
Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages some defined actions like grasping, but also uses custom actions

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

FSM 6_2:
State Coverage: 7 - Key states present but lacks assessment/monitoring
Transition Coverage: 6 - Handles some key cases but many gaps 
Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Strict linear sequence of states
Safety Mindset: 6 - Focuses on cleaning over safety
Scalability: 5 - Very specific to laundry room scenario 
Assistance UX: 3 - Very robotic, optimized for room not human
Action Set Alignment: 7 - Good usage of canonical actions like grasping, mopping

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.4  

FSM 6_3:  
State Coverage: 9 - Broad coverage of major states  
Transition Coverage: 8 - Connects states well for main flows
Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Some conditional branches based on state checks
Safety Mindset: 9 - Prioritizes safety and precautionary states
Scalability: 7 - Structure helps extend but state details limit
Assistance UX: 7 - Attempts some contextual interactions  
Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages canonical actions, minimal customization

Overall Benchmark Score: 8  

FSM 6_4:
State Coverage: 8 - Key states for laundry room scenario
Transition Coverage: 7 - Handles likely sequences reasonably well  
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Mostly linear transitions
Safety Mindset: 7 - Safety is a consideration but not the priority
Scalability: 6 - Some modularity but tightly coupled to room
Assistance UX: 5 - Structured but not situational interactions  
Action Set Alignment: 9 - Focused usage of standard action vocabulary

Overall Benchmark Score: 7

FSM 6_5:
State Coverage: 7 - Has assessment and monitoring but misses some useful states around safety
Transition Coverage: 6 - Decent transitions covering normal flows
Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strictly linear/sequential transitions
Safety Mindset: 5 - Light consideration for safety issues
Scalability: 4 - Tight coupling limits flexibility for extension 
Assistance UX: 3 - Very simple predefined interactions  
Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages canonical physical actions for home

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3

FSM 6_6:  
State Coverage: 7 - Key states present but lacks precautionary/safety states
Transition Coverage: 6 - Reasonable transition coverage for normal flows
Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strictly linear state transitions 
Safety Mindset: 4 - Minimal considerations for safety
Scalability: 5 - Some modularity but constrained flexibility
Assistance UX: 3 - Structured, limited assistance modes
Action Set Alignment: 7 - Aligns with some standard actions like mopping

Overall Benchmark Score: 5

In summary, FSM 6_3 demonstrates the strongest overall benchmark score at 8 out of 10 by focusing more holistically on safety along with broad state coverage and leveraging the standard action vocabulary. FSM 6_1 also shows promise but lacks in certain dimensions like Assistance UX. The other FSMs have lower overall scores due to weaknesses in areas like safety, scalability, UX and complexity.
