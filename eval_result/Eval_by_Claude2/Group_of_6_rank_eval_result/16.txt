 Here are my analysis and scores of the additional FSMs provided:

FSM 16_1:

1. State Coverage: 8 - It covers almost all necessary states like assessing situation, clearing hazards, engaging child, monitoring, and calling for help. Does not have an explicit state for moving child to safety.  

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Transitions seem fairly complete between states like assessing situation, clearing hazards, engaging child etc. Lacks transitions handling things going wrong.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - There is some interconnectivity between states but it is reasonably modular.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Good focus on clearing hazards, monitoring safety, and calling for help. But no backup if child ignores toys.

5. Scalability: 7 - Structure seems extensible but some logic embedded in states.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Mostly responsive but could be more personalized.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses a good variety of actions like monitoring, reminding, gathering, delivering. But also includes some custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.4

FSM 16_2: 

1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers key states needed - check situation, move child, move objects, monitor.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Good connectivity between states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Reasonably interconnected.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Prioritizes moving child first. Continuously monitors.

5. Scalability: 8 - Good encapsulation easy to build upon.

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Structured interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Leverages many defined actions like monitoring, collecting, transporting.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.3

FSM 16_3:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Has necessary states - assess, approach, protect, warn, call for help. No backups.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions between states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Somewhat interconnected.  

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Focused on protection. Calls help.

5. Scalability: 7 - Some reusable logic but enhancements require changes.

6. Assistance UX: 8 - Contextual warnings and protection.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Good usage but also some custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.6

FSM 16_4: 

1. State Coverage: 7 - Covers core states though backups like moving child are missing.

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Has transitions between core states, but lacks redundancy.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear structure.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to address danger. No contingency if child ignores toys.  

5. Scalability: 8 - Clean separation of states and reusable actions.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Functional interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Leverages a few key actions. Could expand vocabulary usage.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3

FSM 16_5:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Main states covered - assess, redirect, secure, monitor, get help.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Connects necessary states, but lacks backups. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear flow.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Prioritizes securing objects and getting help.

5. Scalability: 7 - Some reusable logic but enhancements require changes.  

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Structured assistance.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 6 - Uses some key actions like removing, calling etc. Could leverage more vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7

FSM 16_6:  

1. State Coverage: 8 - Necessary states of move, secure, engage, monitor present. But contingency states absent.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Main state transitions exist. But lacks redundancy paths.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Largely linear structure.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Secures hazards and monitors child. No backup if engagement fails.

5. Scalability: 7 - Some reusable logic but tightly coupled.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Functional.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Decent usage of core actions like grasping, placing etc. But also custom actions. 

Overall Benchmark Score: 6

To summarize, FSM 16_2 has the highest overall benchmark score of 8.3 followed closely by 16_1. They better encapsulate necessary states, transitions, reusable logic, safety focus and leverage home assistant action vocabulary. FSM 16_4, 16_5 and 16_6 have lower scores primarily owing to lack of contingency handling. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
