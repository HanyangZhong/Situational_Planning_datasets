 Here are my analysis and scores for the FSMs provided:

FSM 23_1:
1. State Coverage: 7 - Has the key states of assessing situation, calming the dog, engaging child, monitoring play. Lacks a concluding safety state.
2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Covers likely sequences of states well.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Some interconnectedness between states but quite linear.  
4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Prioritizes calming dog and keeping child safe.
5. Scalability: 6 - Additional context would require changes to state conditions.
6. Assistance UX: 5 - Focuses on safety over child engagement.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses variety of defined actions like grasping, shaking, delivering.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

FSM 23_2: 
1. State Coverage: 6 - Key states of assessing, monitoring, getting help. Lacks states for calming dog or concluding interaction.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent coverage of sequences.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Mostly linear transitions.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Calls for help if unsafe.  
5. Scalability: 5 - Requires changes to add contexts.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Creates distractions but not much child engagement.
7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses collecting, delivering defined actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0

FSM 23_3:
1. State Coverage: 8 - Assesses play, engages child, monitors play, calls for help.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Covers likely sequences.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Some interconnectivity between states.
4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Monitors for safety and offers alternative play.
5. Scalability: 7 - Encapsulates complexity decently.
6. Assistance UX: 8 - Gentle, alternative play engagement.  
7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Uses general assisting verbs.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.0

FSM 23_4: 
1. State Coverage: 7 - Assesses and monitors play, intervenes when rough, calls for help.
2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Models sequences well.  
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Some interconnectivity.
4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Intervenes if play is rough.   
5. Scalability: 7 - Encapsulates complexity fairly well.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Focuses on safety over child engagement.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses variety of defined actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.3

FSM 23_5:
1. State Coverage: 5 - Observes, redirects dog, comforts child. Lacks concluding safety state.  
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Decent sequence coverage.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very linear.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Redirects dog when play rough.
5. Scalability: 4 - Requires overhaul to add contexts.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - Comforts child but very rigid.
7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Uses some aligned verbs like grasping.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3

FSM 23_6:  
1. State Coverage: 6 - Observes, warns, intervenes. Lacks concluding safety state.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Models likely sequences.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strictly linear structure.  
4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Physically separates child and dog.
5. Scalability: 5 - Adding complexity requires changes.
6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very rigid rule-based interactions. 
7. Action Set Alignment: 6 - Uses a few defined actions like grabbing, leading.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7

In summary, FSM 23_3 has the highest overall benchmark score of 7.0. It has good state coverage to assess, engage, and monitor the play interaction. The transitions model likely sequences, and it takes a strong safety mindset by monitoring risks and offering alternative play. It also has the best user experience by gently engaging the child.

FSM 23_4 also scores well at 7.3, intervening if the play gets too rough and using clearly defined assistance actions. FSM 23_1 covers key states decently but lacks strong interconnectivity between states. The remaining FSMs lack coverage of concluding safety states and scalability.
