 Here is my analysis of the FSMs:

18_1
State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states but missing finer details for full coverage
Transition Coverage: 7 - Mostly connected but some logical gaps 
Complexity: 5 - Moderately complex with 5 states
Safety Mindset: 7 - Attempts to address safety but could do more
Scalability: 6 - Structure helps somewhat but tight coupling limits flexibility
UX: 5 - Some assistance behaviors but quite robotic 
Action Alignment: 3 - Introduces many custom actions beyond standard set

Overall Score: 5.9

18_2
State Coverage: 7 - Covers high-level states but lacks nuanced detail  
Transition Coverage: 6 - Logical gaps in transitions
Complexity: 6 - Slightly complex with 6 states  
Safety Mindset: 8 - Prioritizes safety in state design
Scalability: 5 - Tight coupling reduces extendibility  
UX: 4 - Quite robotic, lacks personalization
Action Alignment: 2 - Heavy use of custom actions

Overall Score: 5.3

18_3
State Coverage: 8 - Thorough states for the scenario
Transition Coverage: 7 - Mostly complete transitions  
Complexity: 6 - Medium complexity
Safety Mindset: 9 - Strong safety orientation   
Scalability: 7 - Structure allows additional states
UX: 6 - Attempts to engage child  
Action Alignment: 3 - Custom actions used 

Overall Score: 6.6

18_4 
State Coverage: 5 - High-level without nuanced states
Transition Coverage: 4 - Significant logical gaps
Complexity: 4 - Simplistic
Safety Mindset: 7 - Addresses safety, but weakly
Scalability: 7 - Simple structure allows changes
UX: 3 - Very robotic, no personalization  
Action Alignment: 0 - No defined actions used

Overall Score: 4.1  

18_5
State Coverage: 7 - Appropriate states, lacks finer points
Transition Coverage: 6 - Logical transitions, some gaps
Complexity: 5 - Lean complexity 
Safety Mindset: 8 - Prioritizes safety
Scalability: 7 - Modular for extensions
UX: 5 - Attempts child engagement
Action Alignment: 1 - Mostly custom actions  

Overall Score: 5.4

18_6 
State Coverage: 6 - Covers basics, lacks details 
Transition Coverage: 5 - Functional transitions  
Complexity: 3 - Very simple
Safety Mindset: 7 - Addresses but minimal coverage
Scalability: 8 - Module structure flexible
UX: 6 - Some personalization attempts
Action Alignment: 2 - Mix of defined and custom actions

Overall Score: 5.3

To summarize, 18_3 has the highest overall benchmark score at 6.6, while 18_4 has the lowest at 4.1. The key strengths and weaknesses are highlighted in the dimension analysis, along with justification through FSM details. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
