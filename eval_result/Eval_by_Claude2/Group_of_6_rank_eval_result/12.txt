 Here are the scoring analysis for each of the FSMs provided on the different dimensions:

FSM 12_1:

1. State Coverage: 7 - Covers main states like assess_situation, clean room, unfold rug, but lacks states for handling specific hazards or assisting the woman.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Good connections between states, but lacks transitions from monitor_woman for if help needed.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear flow from state to state.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Cleans up tripping hazards but doesn't directly ensure woman's safety.

5. Scalability: 4 - Specific to current scenario context, not encapsulated.

6. Assistance UX: 3 - Focused on room not personalized assistance.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses standard actions like collecting, pushing, unfolding.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0


FSM 12_2:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers clearing hazards, adjusting furniture, monitoring.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions, but lacks fallback if hazards reappear.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Largely linear transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Removing hazards considered but no direct occupant safety.  

5. Scalability: 5 - Tied to specific living room context.

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Indirect assistance by clearing space.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Well aligned actions like grasping, sliding.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3


FSM 12_3:

1. State Coverage: 9 - Wide coverage of states for various situations.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Robust connections between states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Some interconnections between states.  

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Directly assists with woman's navigation.

5. Scalability: 6 - Still specific to current context.

6. Assistance UX: 8 - Focused on assisting pregnant woman. 

7. Action Set Alignment: 6 - Some non-standard actions like adjusting lighting.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.3


FSM 12_4:  

1. State Coverage: 6 - Light coverage, lacks post-hazard assistance.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Linear flow, lacks fallback transitions.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Purely linear state transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Considers tripping hazards.

5. Scalability: 4 - Highly specific to exact scenario.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Indirect navigation assistance.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Checks rug but lacks manipulation actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3


FSM 12_5:

1. State Coverage: 7 - Decent coverage of key states.

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Straightforward connections.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strictly linear transitions.  

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Actively clears hazards.

5. Scalability: 5 - Still tied to current context. 

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Guides woman through room.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Grasping, transporting aligned actions.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3


FSM 12_6:

1. State Coverage: 6 - Covers key states but lacks depth.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Transitions present but not robust.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Mostly linear state flow.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Clears path hazards.

5. Scalability: 6 - Fairly generic but tied to context.

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Guides pregnant woman.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Some picking up objects.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7
