 Here is my analysis of the additional FSMs provided relative to the benchmark "22_best" FSM:

FSM 22_1:
State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like monitoring, moving to button, pressing button, etc. but lacks assessments of the woman's condition.  
Transition Coverage: 7 - Connects states reasonably well but lacks transitions based on changes in the woman's condition.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linearly moves from state to state without much interconnectivity.
Safety Mindset: 6 - Tries to help the woman but doesn't continually assess her wellbeing.  
Scalability: 7 - Structure is extendable but lacks abstractions.
Assistance UX: 5 - Rather robotic with rigid state transitions.
Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages reaching, pressing, monitoring actions well.
Overall Benchmark Score: 6.6

FSM 22_2: 
State Coverage: 7 - Covers key states though combines assist and monitor states.
Transition Coverage: 8 - Has transitions for main cases like woman's condition and button reaching.  
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Largely linear transitions from state to state.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Attempts to call for help if states fail but lacks ongoing assessments. 
Scalability: 6 - Hardcodes states instead of using more abstract representations.
Assistance UX: 4 - Feels robotic without personalization.
Action Set Alignment: 5 - Utilizes reaching, pressing, and calling actions.
Overall Benchmark Score: 6.1  
   
FSM 22_3:
State Coverage: 5 - Very simple with only assess, reach button, and call for help states.   
Transition Coverage: 4 - Minimal transitions based solely on button reachability.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Extremely linear back and forth between states.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Quickly tries to call for help if the button is unreachable.  
Scalability: 3 - Hardcoded states resist extension.
Assistance UX: 2 - Only focuses on reaching the button.
Action Set Alignment: 4 - Leverages reaching, checking, and calling actions.
Overall Benchmark Score: 4.1

FSM 22_4: 
State Coverage: 6 - Has assessment along with reach and call for help states.
Transition Coverage: 5 - Transitions based on reachability but lacks ongoing assessments.   
Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Mostly linear transitions.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to lower the button or call for help.  
Scalability: 5 - Uses some abstractions but with hardcoded states. 
Assistance UX: 4 - Task oriented without personalization.  
Action Set Alignment: 6 - Employs reaching, checking, lowering, and calling actions.
Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3

FSM 22_5:
State Coverage: 6 - Covers reassurance, transport, etc. but misses key assessments.
Transition Coverage: 5 - Transitions seem prescripted rather than condition based.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strictly linear movement from one state to next.  
Safety Mindset: 5 - Lacks ongoing assessments and help calls if needed.
Scalability: 7 - Breaks states into extensions of base classes.  
Assistance UX: 6 - Attempts reassurances but quite rigid.
Action Set Alignment: 5 - Leverages some vocabulary like lifting, transporting. 
Overall Benchmark Score: 5.4

FSM 22_6:  
State Coverage: 7 - Assesses situation, supports woman, presses button, etc.
Transition Coverage: 6 - Has some condition based transitions but gaps remain.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Mostly linear with minimal interconnectivity.
Safety Mindset: 8 - Supports woman and stays until help arrives.
Scalability: 7 - Utilizes some abstractions for states and actions.  
Assistance UX: 6 - Tries to carefully support the woman.
Action Set Alignment: 5 - Employs support, press, and check actions.
Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3

The "22_best" FSM provides exemplary state and transition coverage tailored specifically for a pregnant woman's safety. It demonstrates greater complexity in support of assistance personalization while remaining scalable through abstractions. Across dimensions, other FSMs exhibit varying gaps relative to this benchmark example that precision tuning could help address.
