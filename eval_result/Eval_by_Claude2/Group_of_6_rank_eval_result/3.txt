 Here is my analysis of the FSMs provided against the benchmark "3_best":

3_1:
State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, extinguishing flame, preserving tea, placing glasses. Does not have states for verifying success or calling for help.  

Transition Coverage: 7 - Reasonably connected transitions between states. Lacks transitions from extinguish flame and preserve tea back to assess in case those actions fail.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linear transitions from assess situation. Not much interconnectivity between states.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Prioritizes extinguishing flame which is good. But lacks mechanisms to verify success.

Scalability: 6 - Structure is decent but tightly coupled to current scenario. Adding new states requires changing assess state.

Assistance UX: 5 - Very functional, not much personalization or context awareness.

Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses reaching, gripping, transporting, releasing, monitoring from standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

3_2: 
State Coverage: 5 - Covers check situation and remove candle but lacks mechanisms to verify success or call for help if needed.

Transition Coverage: 4 - Linear transitions, no fail-safe transitions back to initial state. 

Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Very simple transitions from one state to next.

Safety Mindset: 6 - Tries to remove candle but no verification of safety.

Scalability: 4 - Hardcoded based on current scenario, not extendable.

Assistance UX: 3 - Purely functional, no personalization.  

Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses checking, gripping, lifting, transporting, releasing from standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.4

3_3:
State Coverage: 7 - Has states to assess situation, cover/remove candle, extinguish fire. No mechanisms for calling help.

Transition Coverage: 5 - Linear transitions. No fail-safes if an action fails.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Simple transitions from one state to next. 

Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to cover/remove candle based on risk. Extinguishes fire.

Scalability: 5 - Structure is decent but still tightly coupled to scenario.

Assistance UX: 4 - Functional, lacks personalization.

Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses reaching, grasping, removing, placing down, blowing from standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.7


3_4: 
State Coverage: 3 - Only assesses situation and calls for help. No mechanisms to actually mitigate candle risk.

Transition Coverage: 2 - Very simple transitions from assess to call for help.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 1 - No interconnectivity between states.

Safety Mindset: 2 - No actual risk mitigation steps.

Scalability: 3 -Structure could be extended but no meaningful states/transitions.

Assistance UX: 2 - Purely simple functional interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 5 - Uses some verbs like reaching, gripping, lowering, transporting from standard set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 2.6

3_5:
State Coverage: 8 - Checks risk, removes combustibles, extinguishes candle, cleans up, monitors.

Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions, but lacks fail-safes.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Some interconnections between states.

Safety Mindset: 8 - Prioritizes risk reduction.

Scalability: 7 - Structure is reusable across scenarios.

Assistance UX: 5 - Lacks personalization, contextual awareness.

Action Set Alignment: 6 - Uses sensing nearby from defined action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7

3_6: 
State Coverage: 6 - Assesses risk, extinguishes candle, cleans up, monitors. But very simple.

Transition Coverage: 5 - Cycles between assess, extinguish and monitor. No fail-safes.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Some interconnections between states.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to reduce risk by extinguishing candle.

Scalability: 5 - Structure is okay but lacks encapsulation.

Assistance UX: 3 - Very simple interactions.

Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses blowing out candle from standard action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.4

In summary, 3_1 has the highest overall benchmark score of 6.7. It covers important states, uses standard action set, and prioritizes safety. However it lacks mechanisms for verifying success or calling for help. 

3_5 also scores decently with 6.7. It assessing risk, reduces combustibles, extinguishes threat, cleans up and monitors subsequently. But it also lacks fail-safes.

The overall scores provide a quantitative assessment, while the dimension specific commentary offers qualitative comparison to precisely tune home assistance FSMs.
