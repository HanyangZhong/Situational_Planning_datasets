 Here are the detailed analysis and scores for the additional FSMs compared to the benchmark "19_best" FSM:

19_1 FSM

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, distracting child, moving pot away and monitoring. Does not have states for securing stove area or ensuring child safety.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Connects states in likely sequences but lacks transitions like going from monitoring back to distraction if child approaches stove again.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Moderate interconnectivity between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to distract child and move pot to prevent burns but does not turn off stove.

5. Scalability: 6 - Structure is decent but tightly couples state functions to robot actions.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very task based interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Leverages defined actions like collecting, delivering, gripping etc. But also introduces custom actions.


Overall Benchmark Score: 6.6


19_2 FSM  

1. State Coverage: 5 - Covers core states of assessing, moving child and getting help but lacks environment monitoring or securing stove.

2. Transition Coverage: 4 - Transitions present but does not check if problem is resolved before getting help.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very linear transitions between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Focuses on removing child from danger but lacks prevention. 

5. Scalability: 5 - Hardcodes states to robot functions which resist extensions.

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Very rigid grab and move interaction.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Leverages actions like gripping, transporting etc. But introduces custom actions like is_child_reaching.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5


19_3 FSM

1. State Coverage: 5 - Covers assessing danger and stopping child but lacks transitions to call for help if needed.

2. Transition Coverage: 3 - Can get stuck repeatedly stopping child reach even if help needed.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - Follows very linear reach out => stop reaching flow.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Tries to stop child but lacks mechanisms to prevent or escape danger.

5. Scalability: 4 - States handle goals instead of reusable composeable behaviors.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Very simple physical reach out interaction.

7. Action Set Alignment: 2 - Develops custom state functions compared to standard actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 4


19_4 FSM

1. State Coverage: 7 - Checks for danger, reaching, and help but misses explicit ensure safety state.  

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Connects key states but always resets to initial instead of continuous monitoring.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Largely linear with minimal branching.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Alerts on danger and gets help but lacks prevention. 

5. Scalability: 5 - Mixes reusable checks like boiling water with custom alerts limiting reuse.

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Focuses only on danger with no child engagement.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Defines custom helper methods rather than leveraging action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.5

19_5 FSM

1. State Coverage: 7 - Approaching child, redirection and monitoring covered but lacks explicit risk prevention by turning off stove.  

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Returns to monitoring state after addressing risk but misses opportunity to disable stove.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Largely linear approach, redirect and monitor flow.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Seeks to move child away from risk but does not remove/reduce risk from environment.  

5. Scalability: 7 - Clearly separates states from reusable risk assessment logic.  

6. Assistance UX: 8 - More natural verbal and physical engagement guiding child away from danger.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Utilizes custom print based state implementations rather than standardized actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6


19_6 FSM  

1. State Coverage: 8 - Approaching child, moving child, turning off stove and calling parents covers key safety states.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Connects critical states in likely sequence but always resets to initial instead of continued monitoring.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strict linear sequence of states.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Seeks to both move child and eliminate risk by turning off stove.  

5. Scalability: 7 - Isolates state logic from actual robot movement capabilities.

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Engages child verbally while moving them through multiple safe states.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses custom print based state functions rather than standardized action vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.25

In summary, the additional FSMs have Overall Benchmark Scores in the 3-7 range compared to the 10 benchmark score of the provided "19_best" FSM. The strengths and weaknesses vary across state coverage, transitions, safety handling, scalability etc. But key opportunities exist to improve state connectivity, preventive safety, and leveraging standardized actions.
