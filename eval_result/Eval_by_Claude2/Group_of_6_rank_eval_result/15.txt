 Based on the scoring dimensions provided, here is my analysis of the FSMs:

15_1:
State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like identifying hazards, fixing outlets, moving plants. Does not have states for cleaning up other hazards.
Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions between states, but no fallbacks if actions fail.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simple transitions between states.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to mitigate hazards, but no fallback states. 
Scalability: 6 - Specific to current context, may require changes to scale.
Assistance UX: 5 - Focuses on tasks rather than user experience.
Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses many actions from standard set.

Overall Score: 6.7

15_2: 
State Coverage: 7 - Checks for hazards and protects against them. No cleanup states.
Transition Coverage: 6 - Switches between states but lacks fallbacks.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Simple back and forth between states.  
Safety Mindset: 8 - Checks and mitigates hazards.
Scalability: 5 - Very specific to current context.
Assistance UX: 4 - Task-oriented, not personalized.
Action Set Alignment: 9 - Leverages standard action verbs.

Overall Score: 6.4

15_3:
State Coverage: 8 - Assesses situation, fixes issues, final completion state.
Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions, initial state branches off.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linear flow from initial to end state.
Safety Mindset: 9 - Methodically checks and fixes safety issues.   
Scalability: 7 - Structure allows additional states if needed.
Assistance UX: 5 - Focused on tasks over user experience.
Action Set Alignment: 9 - Aligns well with standard actions.

Overall Score: 7.1  

15_4: 
State Coverage: 8 - Assesses, fixes hazards, finishes.
Transition Coverage: 7 - Branches from assess state, loops back.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Some interconnections between states.
Safety Mindset: 9 - Identifies and fixes safety issues.
Scalability: 8 - Structure makes additional states easy.
Assistance UX: 7 - Prints updates to user at each state.  
Action Set Alignment: 5 - Uses custom actions.

Overall Score: 7.0

15_5:
State Coverage: 7 - Phases for assessment and fixing. No cleanup. 
Transition Coverage: 6 - Linear flow, repeated hazard checks.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Strict linear flow.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to mitigate hazards.
Scalability: 4 - Needs significant changes to scale up.   
Assistance UX: 3 - No user interaction.
Action Set Alignment: 2 - Placeholder functions only.  

Overall Score: 4.7

15_6: 
State Coverage: 7 - Phases for hazard handling.
Transition Coverage: 6 - Branches based on detected hazards.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Mostly linear flow.
Safety Mindset: 8 - Focused on hazard mitigation. 
Scalability: 6 - Structure supports additional states.
Assistance UX: 4 - Prints status, no personalization.
Action Set Alignment: 3 - Custom placeholder functions.

Overall Score: 5.6

In summary, 15_3 has the best coverage of necessary states and transitions, as well as good safety mindset and action alignment. 15_4 also scores well for its scalability and user experience. The other FSMs have lower scores due to gaps in coverage, transitions, safety consideration, and action alignment.
