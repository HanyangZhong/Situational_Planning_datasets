 Here are the detailed scores and analysis for each FSM code compared to the "14_best" benchmark:

Code 14_1:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers key states like assessing situation, removing hazards, distracting cat, monitoring, and calling for help. Does not explicitly handle scenarios if cat ingests toxic food.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions between states, but does not cover what to do if cat is not distracted after serving food.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Fairly linear state transitions, could be more adaptive.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Proactively removes hazards and monitors situation. Does not cover emergency scenario if cat ate toxic food.  

5. Scalability: 7 - Structure makes it easy to add more hazard removal and distraction states. Overall system logic may get complex with scale.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Functionally assists the user but interactions are basic.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses valid action verbs but does not utilize the full benchmark vocabulary. Introduces custom "serving cat food" action.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.3

Code 14_2:

1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers key states required for the scenario. No major gaps.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Handles likely sequences of states well. Transitions back to monitoring state appropriately.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Slightly intertwined states but overall understandable complexity.

4. Safety Mindset: 9 - Proactively secures area and alerts owner. Focuses on safety.

5. Scalability: 8 - Modular states make extensions possible. May need refactoring for more complex contexts.  

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Decent user experience with alerting owner but lacks personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - Utilizes some defined actions like gripping, lifting but also introduces custom actions like "relocate cat".

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.7

Code 14_3: 

1. State Coverage: 7 - Handles key states but does not explicitly address ingestion emergency.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Covers likely sequences. Transitions back to monitoring appropriately. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Fairly simple transitions between a small set of states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Helps cat after on counter and can call for help. But safety could be more proactive.

5. Scalability: 6 - Structure is okay but may require significant rework for handling more scenarios.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Assists user but interactions are basic. Lacks personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses some verbs like monitoring, calling but also introduces unsupported custom actions like "remove toxic foods".

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0

Code 14_4:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Relevant states for the scenario. Does not explicitly cover ingestion emergency. 

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Handles likely sequences. Can get stuck in call for help state.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Fairly simple transitions between a small set of states.

4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Tries to proactively engage cat and remove hazards.

5. Scalability: 7 - Structure works for this case but may need significant rework for other scenarios.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Functionally assists but interactions are basic.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Utilizes few defined actions like calling, checking. Mainly uses custom unsupported actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3

Code 14_5:

1. State Coverage: 7 - Relevant states for scenario, but gaps in handling emergencies.

2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Covers likely sequences reasonably well.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Very linear set of transitions between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to handle hazards but safety could be more proactive.

5. Scalability: 6 - Structure works for this case, but extensions may require significant rework.

6. Assistance UX: 7 - Has some contextual cues with print statements, but limited personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 3 - Leverages few defined actions like transporting, grasping. Mainly custom.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.0

Code 14_6:

1. State Coverage: 6 - Has some relevant states, but lacks emergency handling.  

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transition coverage between states.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Very simple set of transitions between a small number of states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Tries to remove hazards, but safety is not proactive enough. 

5. Scalability: 5 - Structure may work for simple cases, but does not encapsulate complexity well.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Limited contextual interaction, lacks personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 4 - Uses some defined actions like grasping, transporting. But also unsupported custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3

In summary, 14_2 has the highest overall benchmark score of 7.7, while 14_best remains the optimal reference implementation with maximum scores. The key strengths and weaknesses have been highlighted along each dimension per FSM. This analysis precisely identifies improvement areas through quantitative and qualitative comparisons.
