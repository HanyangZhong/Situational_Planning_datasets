 Here are the analysis and scores for the FSMs provided:

FSM 11_1:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers main states needed to handle the scene like assessing situation, retrieving medicine and delivering it. Does not have states for follow up care.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Has decent transitions to cover likely sequence of states. Lacks transitions for error handling.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Has a simple linear flow with each state having 1 following state. Not dense interconnectivity.

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Tries to assist person in need but lacks mechanisms for handling failures/exceptions.

5. Scalability: 6 - Structure somewhat modular but transitions are hardcoded limiting extendibility.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Interactions to deliver medicine seem robotic without personalization.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Mainly uses actions like reaching, grasping defined in the benchmark list.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4

FSM 11_2:

1. State Coverage: 6 - Covers core states but lacks complexity for follow up care after medicine delivery.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Very simple transitions between states. No branches for contingencies.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Extremely linear flow with minimal interconnectivity between states.  

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Can call for help but limited proactiveness for safety.

5. Scalability: 4 - Hardcoded transitions resist extension to new states for scale.

6. Assistance UX: 4 - Task focused interactions lack personalization.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - Leverages benchmark actions like reaching, grasping etc.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.0

FSM 11_3: 

1. State Coverage: 6 - Has assessment, medicine reach and delivery states. Follow up care missing.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Linear transitions, no support for contingencies.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Each state has one following state, no interconnectivity.  

4. Safety Mindset: 5 - Can call for help but no mechanisms for proactive safety.  

5. Scalability: 5 - Hardcoded transitions make extension difficult.

6. Assistance UX: 6 - Simple textual interactions to guide person.

7. Action Set Alignment: 2 - Checks status but does not actually perform physical actions.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.6

FSM 11_4:

1. State Coverage: 7 - Covers assessment, medicine reach and delivery. Lacks detailed follow-up care.  

2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Has branches for help if medicine cannot be reached.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - Some interconnectivity between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Calls for help if medicine cannot be reached, preventing harm.  

5. Scalability: 5 - Framework is extendible but transitions are hardcoded.
 
6. Assistance UX: 3 - No actual assistance interactions with person.

7. Action Set Alignment: 1 - Placeholder methods, does not use benchmark actions.

Overall Benchmark Score: 4.7

FSM 11_5:  

1. State Coverage: 6 - Main states for assessment, retrieval and delivery.

2. Transition Coverage: 5 - Simple linear transitions between states.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Each state has one following state.  

4. Safety Mindset: 4 - No mechanisms for safety/error handling.

5. Scalability: 6 - Fairly modular structure, can add states.

6. Assistance UX: 5 - Simple medication assistance interactions.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses benchmark actions like grasp, carry.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3

FSM 11_6:

1. State Coverage: 8 - Covers assessment, retrieval, delivery and monitoring.

2. Transition Coverage: 7 - Branches for continued assistance if needed.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Some interconnectivity between states.  

4. Safety Mindset: 6 - Can provide incremental assistance, but no safety mechanisms.
 
5. Scalability: 7 - Modular states makes extension possible.
   
6. Assistance UX: 8 - Personalized interactions to provide medicine and help.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - Uses benchmark action verbs through the FSM.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.0

In summary, FSM 11_1 has the highest overall benchmark score of 6.4, while FSM 11_2 has the lowest score of 5.0. The scores are relative to the "perfect 10" benchmark set by the reference FSM 11_best across the scoring dimensions. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
