 Here are my analysis and scores for the additional FSMs provided:

FSM 10_1:
State Coverage: 8 - Covers main states like assessing situation, moving chair, monitoring study, and calling for help. But lacks finer details. 
Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions covering likely sequences. But lacks transitions like from calling help back to monitoring in case more help needed.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simplistic state connectivity, does not handle all possible state transitions.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Attempts to clear path and check, but no redundant fallbacks if fails.
Scalability: 6 - Structure is extendable, but state details are lacking.
Assistance UX: 5 - Very rigid and robotic interaction model.
Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses some actions like checking, grasping, dragging, releasing, monitoring and calling for help from standard list. But also introduces custom actions like assess_situation(), move_chair() etc.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.71

FSM 10_2:
State Coverage: 7 - Covers major states but lacks finer details. No explicit final success state.
Transition Coverage: 8 - Models transitions well, but lacks fallback transitions.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Average state interconnectivity complexity.
Safety Mindset: 7 - Checks after moving chair, but no redundancy.
Scalability: 7 - Structure is conducive for extensions.
Assistance UX: 6 - Decent interaction model, but very robotic.
Action Set Alignment: 9 - Leverages reaching, gripping, lifting, lowering etc. from standard action set, with few custom actions.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.14

FSM 10_3: 
State Coverage: 9 - Models key states required. Clear start, finish and desired outcomes.
Transition Coverage: 8 - Handles transitions well. Fallback from move to clear path.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Interconnectivity is logical. 
Safety Mindset: 7 - Assesses first before acting, but lacks redundancies.
Scalability: 8 - Structure allows additional states to be inserted easily.
Assistance UX: 7 - Interaction model captures key actions linearly.
Action Set Alignment: 10 - Uses reaching, gripping, lifting, lowering, releasing, checking etc. from the defined action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: 8.28  

FSM 10_4:
State Coverage: 9 - Necessary states like assess, move obstacle, clear path, reach desk covered.
Transition Coverage: 8 - Models transitions across states, but lacks fallback logic.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Logical state connectivity complexity.
Safety Mindset: 6 - Assesses first but no fallback safety checks.  
Scalability: 8 - Modular states allow extensions.
Assistance UX: 7 - Decent contextual interaction model.
Action Set Alignment: 9 - Leverages reaching, gripping, dragging, placing down etc. from standard vocabulary.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.71

FSM 10_5:  
State Coverage: 7 - High level states to assist are present. Lacks finer details.
Transition Coverage: 6 - Transition handling is basic without contingencies.  
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Simplistic linear state connectivity.
Safety Mindset: 6 - Confirm access, but no redundant safety checks.
Scalability: 6 - Structure can be extended with more states.
Assistance UX: 7 - Models helpful contextual interaction.
Action Set Alignment: 3 - Uses very few actions like print, boolean checks from standard vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: 5.71

FSM 10_6:
State Coverage: 8 - Covers assessment, mitigating actions, monitoring states.
Transition Coverage: 7 - Decent transitions, but lacks fallback logic.
Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Average interconnectedness between states.  
Safety Mindset: 8 - Monitors situation, covers pool, engages children safely.
Scalability: 7 - Allows adding states modularly.
Assistance UX: 7 - Models contextual and personalized assistance. 
Action Set Alignment: 4 - Uses time.sleep() and custom print actions mostly.  

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.85

In summary, FSM 10_3 has the highest overall benchmark score of 8.28. It strikes a good balance across assessing needs, clearing obstacles, safety checks and scalable structure with decent UX. FSM 10_1, 10_2 and 10_4 also score reasonably well, but have some gaps in complexity handling, safety and UX. FSM 10_5 and 10_6 can be improved significantly by increasing coverage, connectivity, safety redundancies and leveraging standard action vocabulary.
