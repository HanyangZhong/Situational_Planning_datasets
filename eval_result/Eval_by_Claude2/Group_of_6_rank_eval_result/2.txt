6.3 Here are the detailed analysis and scores for each FSM code compared to the benchmark "2_best":

**Code 2_1:**

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Covers key states like recognizing hazard, cleaning up, monitoring. Does not explicitly handle other non-spill hazards. 

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Main sequences are handled, but lacks transitions for unexpected situations.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Fairly linear, could be more interconnected between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Cleans up spill for safety but lacks preparations/warnings.

5. Scalability: 6/10 - Structure is okay but tightly coupled to spill scenario. Adding states may require changes to existing code.  

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very functional, but interactions are simplistic.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Uses some defined actions like checking, grabbing, mopping. But also introduces unnamed custom actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score:** 6.3/10


**Code 2_2:**

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Handles spill but does not monitor afterwards.

2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - Main clean up sequence covered, but lacks complexity. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10 - Very linear, minimal interconnectivity between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - Focuses on cleaning up spill.

5. Scalability: 5/10 - Hardcoded specifically for spill, difficult to extend functionality.

6. Assistance UX: 4/10 - Very rigid and instructive tone.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - Leverages many defined actions. Some custom actions remain.

**Overall Benchmark Score:** 5.7/10


**Code 2_3:**  

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Monitors situation before and after cleanup.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Loops back from monitoring to cleanup.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Mostly linear with some interconnectivity.

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Prioritizes cleaning for safety.

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Structure is reusable for other hazard scenarios.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - Still fairly rigid but allows for monitoring.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Defines states around standard actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score:** 7.3/10


**Code 2_4:**

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Assesses, cleans up, and checks kitchen.

2. Transition Coverage: 8/10 - Cycles back through multiple states.  

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - Jumps between several states.

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Covering and cleaning floor, checking kitchen.  

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Structure works for various hazards.

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Very functional, lacks contextual interactions.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10 - Many standard actions used.

**Overall Benchmark Score:** 7.6/10


**Code 2_5:**

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - Assesses, blocks, cleans. No post clean checks.

2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - each state flows linearly to the next.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2/10 - Purely linear structure.   

4. Safety Mindset: 8/10 - Blocks kitchen access and cleans.

5. Scalability: 5/10 - Specific to spill scenario.

6. Assistance UX: 3/10 - Minimal contextual interaction.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5/10 - Uses almost no standard actions. 

**Overall Benchmark Score:** 5.3/10


**Code 2_6:**

1. State Coverage: 8/10 - Good coverage, no post clean validation.  

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Loops back from checking state.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - Mostly linear with some jumps back.

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Barriers and cleaning for safety.

5. Scalability: 7/10 - Structure extends well to other hazards.   

6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Functional, not very personalized.

7. Action Set Alignment: 5/10 - Uses almost no vocabulary actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score:** 6.7/10
