 Here is my analysis of the FSMs provided:

**FSM 7_1**

1. State Coverage: 8/10. It covers most necessary states like assessing, cleaning, arranging, fixing hazards. It does not have an explicit monitoring state.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10. The state transitions flow logically from one to next. But lacks transitions back to previous states for rework.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10. The connectivity between states is linear. Does not allow going back to prior states.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10. Tries to clean and arrange items to prevent hazards. But lacks monitoring states.  

5. Scalability: 6/10. Structure is decent but transitions are rigid. Adding states requires overhaul.

6. Assistance UX: 5/10. Very functional flow focused mainly on room state changes.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10. Uses many standard actions like collecting, lifting, placing down. But also uses some custom actions like affixing, fixing.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7/10**

**FSM 7_2** 

1. State Coverage: 7/10. Covers key states of assess, pickup, arrange. No monitoring state.

2. Transition Coverage: 8/10. Allows iterating on pickup state until done.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10. Very linear basic transitions.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10. Tries to address clutter but no ongoing monitoring.

5. Scalability: 5/10. Hardcoded sequential transitions resist change.  

6. Assistance UX: 6/10. Functional but not contextualized.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10. Excellent use of standard actions like grasping, lifting, transporting.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4/10**


**FSM 7_3**

1. State Coverage: 9/10. Broad coverage of necessary states even monitoring.

2. Transition Coverage: 8/10. Allows backwards transitions for rework.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10. Decent interconnectivity between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 9/10. Actively monitors environment.

5. Scalability: 8/10. Abstraction enables controlled growth.

6. Assistance UX: 7/10. Still fairly functional but more contextual.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10. Uses many standard actions like transporting, folding, arranging.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 8.1/10**

**FSM 7_4**

1. State Coverage: 7/10. Has assessment and navigation but lacks detail.

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10. Transitions are uni-directional.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10. Strictly linear progression of states.  

4. Safety Mindset: 6/10. Attempts hazard cleanup but no monitoring.

5. Scalability: 7/10. Abstracted states allow some flexibility.

6. Assistance UX: 5/10. Purely functional.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10. Leverages standard actions like picking up, organizing.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 5.9/10**

**FSM 7_5** 

1. State Coverage: 8/10. Has assessment, cleanup, monitoring states.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10. Allows backwards transitions. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10. Decent interconnectivity between states.

4. Safety Mindset: 8/10. Actively monitors environment.  

5. Scalability: 7/10. Reasonably extensible but transitions hard-coded.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10. Still focused on space state changes.

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10. Uses many standard actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 7.3/10**

**FSM 7_6**

1. State Coverage: 8/10. Broad coverage of major states.

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10. Strictly linear uni-directional.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10. Overly simplistic connectivity.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10. Tries to address hazards.

5. Scalability: 6/10. Abstracted states help but transitions rigid. 

6. Assistance UX: 5/10. Purely functional.  

7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10. Leverages standard action vocabulary.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 6.3/10**
