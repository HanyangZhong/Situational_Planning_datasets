 Here are the detailed analysis and scores for each FSM code:

**17_1 Analysis:**

State Coverage: 7 - Covers key states like monitoring, engaging child, blocking stairs. Does not have detailed states for verifying safety.

Transition Coverage: 8 - Has transitions from each state to address likely scenarios. No fallbacks if actions fail.  

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Linear transitions from one state to next. No redundancy or fallback states.

Safety Mindset: 4 - Attempts to block stairs but no verification of child safety.

Scalability: 8 - Additional states can be inserted without much change.

Assistance UX: 6 - Distracts child but does not comfort or explain situation.

Action Set Alignment: 8 - Uses collecting, delivering, inserting, calling verbs from standard action set.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 6.4**

**17_2 Analysis:** 

State Coverage: 8 - Covers assessment, movement of child, barrier placement, getting help.

Transition Coverage: 9 - Accounts for changes in situation to transition states.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - Some interconnections between states like calling for help.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Safe lifting and transport but lacks safety verification.  

Scalability: 8 - Additional complexity can be handled in states.

Assistance UX: 7 - Transports child but lacks explain or comfort actions.

Action Set Alignment: 9 - Uses variety of canonical action verbs.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 7.7**


**17_3 Analysis:**

State Coverage: 5 - Relevant states missing like barrier placement, visual tracking.

Transition Coverage: 4 - Disconnected states without factoring in situation changes.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - Largely linear state transitions.

Safety Mindset: 7 - Closes gas valve for safety.

Scalability: 7 - Additional states can be inserted modularly. 

Assistance UX: 4 - Lacks any child engagement or communication.

Action Set Alignment: 5 - Utilizes some canonical action verbs like closing, opening.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 5.3**


**17_4 Analysis:**

State Coverage: 8 - Has assessment, barrier setup, child monitoring states. 

Transition Coverage: 7 - Changes states based on presence of child near stairs.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Some interconnections between states.

Safety Mindset: 9 - Gets safety gate and monitors child.

Scalability: 8 - Additional complexity can be handled.

Assistance UX: 5 - No child engagement or communication actions.

Action Set Alignment: 9 - Many canonical action verbs used.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 7.4**

**17_5 Analysis:**

State Coverage: 8 - Assessment, movement, barrier, monitoring states covered.

Transition Coverage: 7 - State changes based on risk levels. 

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - Some interconnections between states.

Safety Mindset: 9 - Moves child, blocks stairs, gets help if needed.  

Scalability: 8 - Encapsulates complexity for extensions.

Assistance UX: 7 - Comforts and explains situation to child.  

Action Set Alignment: 5 - Uses some canonical action verbs at abstract level.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 7.1**


**17_6 Analysis:**  

State Coverage: 8 - Assessment, redirection, barrier, monitoring states covered.

Transition Coverage: 7 - Changes state based on detections.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - Mostly linear state transitions.  

Safety Mindset: 7 - Barriers stairs but lacks safety verifications.

Scalability: 9 - Clearly encapsulates complexity.

Assistance UX: 7 - Transports child, explains stairs danger.

Action Set Alignment: 7 - Uses variety of canonical action verbs.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 7.3**
