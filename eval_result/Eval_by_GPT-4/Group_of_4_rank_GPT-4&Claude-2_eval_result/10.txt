To evaluate the FSMs in the codes "10_1", "10_2", "10_3", and "10_4" against the benchmark established by "10_best", we will analyze each FSM across the seven dimensions: State Coverage, Transition Coverage, Cyclomatic Complexity, Safety Mindset, Scalability, Assistance UX, and Action Set Alignment. We will then summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each FSM and calculate their Overall Benchmark Scores.

### 1. "10_1" FSM Analysis:

#### State Coverage: 7/10
- This FSM covers most necessary states like 'INITIAL', 'ASSESS_SITUATION', 'MOVE_CHAIR', 'MONITOR_STUDY', and 'CALL_FOR_HELP'. However, it lacks specific states for environmental monitoring and direct owner assistance.

#### Transition Coverage: 8/10
- The FSM shows a good sequence of state transitions but could potentially loop indefinitely in 'MONITOR_STUDY' if certain conditions are not met.

#### Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10
- Complexity is moderate; states are interconnected but not overly complex.

#### Safety Mindset: 6/10
- The FSM includes a 'CALL_FOR_HELP' state, suggesting safety awareness, but does not explicitly manage safety throughout.

#### Scalability: 6/10
- The FSM can be extended to new contexts, but modifications might require significant changes to the state structure.

#### Assistance UX: 7/10
- The FSM seems user-focused, particularly with the 'CALL_FOR_HELP' state, but could be more adaptive to user needs.

#### Action Set Alignment: 8/10
- Actions like 'grasping', 'dragging', 'releasing', and 'calling' align well with the benchmark action set vocabulary.

#### Overall Benchmark Score: 6.7/10

### 2. "10_2" FSM Analysis:

#### State Coverage: 8/10
- This FSM covers important states like 'CHECK_PATH', 'MOVE_CHAIR', 'CHECK_CHAIR_POSITION', and 'RETURN_TO_USER', addressing the scenario well.

#### Transition Coverage: 7/10
- Good transitions, but potential for repetitive cycles between 'MOVE_CHAIR' and 'CHECK_CHAIR_POSITION'.

#### Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10
- Moderately complex with some interconnected states.

#### Safety Mindset: 7/10
- Indicates a focus on user safety through careful positioning of the chair.

#### Scalability: 7/10
- The structure allows for scalability, but adding new states for different scenarios may require substantial reconfiguration.

#### Assistance UX: 8/10
- The FSM is user-centric, with clear attention to the user's need to access the desk.

#### Action Set Alignment: 9/10
- Aligns closely with the benchmark action set, using actions like 'reaching', 'gripping', 'lifting', 'transporting', and 'monitoring'.

#### Overall Benchmark Score: 7.4/10

### 3. "10_3" FSM Analysis:

#### State Coverage: 5/10
- Covers basic states but lacks detailed handling of the environment and specific user needs.

#### Transition Coverage: 5/10
- Transitions are straightforward but lack complexity and may not cover all possible scenarios.

#### Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10
- Low complexity; lacks interconnectedness and depth in state transitions.

#### Safety Mindset: 4/10
- Minimal emphasis on safety, mostly focused on task completion.

#### Scalability: 4/10
- Limited scalability due to its simplistic structure.

#### Assistance UX: 5/10
- Basic user interaction but lacks depth in personalization and adaptability.

#### Action Set Alignment: 4/10
- Limited alignment with the benchmark action set; many actions are not explicitly defined within the benchmark vocabulary.

#### Overall Benchmark Score: 4.3/10

### 4. "10_4" FSM Analysis:

#### State Coverage: 6/10
- Addresses a variety of states but is not entirely aligned with the specific scenario of mobility assistance.

#### Transition Coverage: 6/10
- Has clear transitions but is oriented towards a different context (pool safety).

#### Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10
- Simpler structure with fewer states and transitions.

#### Safety Mindset: 7/10
- Strong focus on safety, especially regarding children and pool safety.

#### Scalability: 5/10
- While adaptable, it's more tailored to specific scenarios and may require significant changes for other contexts.

#### Assistance UX: 6/10
- Decent user interaction but not fully aligned with the home study scenario.

#### Action Set Alignment: 5/10
- Some alignment with the benchmark action set, but many actions are context-specific and not directly related to home assistance.

#### Overall Benchmark Score: 5.6/10
