To evaluate and score the FSMs in "7_1", "7_2", "7_3", and "7_4" against the benchmark set by "7_best", I'll analyze each FSM across the seven dimensions: State Coverage, Transition Coverage, Cyclomatic Complexity, Safety Mindset, Scalability, Assistance UX, and Action Set Alignment. The scores will be on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the highest level of achievement in each dimension. Let's start the analysis:

### 1. "7_1" FSM Analysis
#### State Coverage
- The FSM covers various aspects, including cleaning, arranging, and safety checks.
- **Score: 8/10**

#### Transition Coverage
- Transitions are logical but lack reactivity to changing conditions.
- **Score: 7/10**

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- Moderate complexity; not too dense but covers necessary states.
- **Score: 6/10**

#### Safety Mindset
- Focuses on cleaning and arranging but lacks explicit safety checks.
- **Score: 6/10**

#### Scalability
- Somewhat extendible but not easily adaptable to new contexts.
- **Score: 5/10**

#### Assistance UX
- Action-oriented but lacks interaction or contextual awareness.
- **Score: 5/10**

#### Action Set Alignment
- Mostly aligns with the defined action set, but some custom actions are present.
- **Score: 7/10**

#### Overall Benchmark Score
- **(8+7+6+6+5+5+7)/7 ≈ 6.3/10**

### 2. "7_2" FSM Analysis
#### State Coverage
- Basic state coverage, focusing on item management.
- **Score: 7/10**

#### Transition Coverage
- Good transitions, but lacks feedback loops for reassessment.
- **Score: 7/10**

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- Less complex, straightforward paths.
- **Score: 4/10**

#### Safety Mindset
- Addresses safety by item management but doesn't explicitly check safety.
- **Score: 6/10**

#### Scalability
- Limited scalability due to its straightforward approach.
- **Score: 4/10**

#### Assistance UX
- More action-based, less interaction.
- **Score: 5/10**

#### Action Set Alignment
- Aligns well with the industry-standard action set.
- **Score: 8/10**

#### Overall Benchmark Score
- **(7+7+4+6+4+5+8)/7 ≈ 5.9/10**

### 3. "7_3" FSM Analysis
#### State Coverage
- Focuses on hazard assessment and clearance.
- **Score: 7/10**

#### Transition Coverage
- Logical transitions but could benefit from more dynamic feedback.
- **Score: 6/10**

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- Moderate complexity, balanced state interconnectivity.
- **Score: 5/10**

#### Safety Mindset
- Strong focus on hazard detection and mitigation.
- **Score: 8/10**

#### Scalability
- Moderately scalable, with some potential for extension.
- **Score: 6/10**

#### Assistance UX
- Functional but lacks personalized user experience.
- **Score: 5/10**

#### Action Set Alignment
- Mostly in line with the standard action set, but some gaps.
- **Score: 7/10**

#### Overall Benchmark Score
- **(7+6+5+8+6+5+7)/7 ≈ 6.3/10**

### 4. "7_4" FSM Analysis
#### State Coverage
- Comprehensive coverage of clearing and securing tasks.
- **Score: 8/10**

#### Transition Coverage
- Good transitions, though somewhat linear.
- **Score: 7/10**

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- Moderate complexity, could benefit from more interconnected states.
- **Score: 6/10**

#### Safety Mindset
- Prioritizes safety in tasks, but lacks continuous safety checks.
- **Score: 7/10**

#### Scalability
- Fairly adaptable to new scenarios.
- **Score: 6/10**

#### Assistance UX
- Action-focused, less on user interaction.
- **Score: 5/10**

#### Action Set Alignment
- Aligns well with industry-standard actions.
- **Score: 8/10**

#### Overall Benchmark Score
- **(8+7+6+7+6+5+8)/7 ≈ 6.7/10**
