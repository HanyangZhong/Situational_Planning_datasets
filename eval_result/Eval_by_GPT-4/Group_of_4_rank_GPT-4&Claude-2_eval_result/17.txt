To evaluate the FSMs in the provided codes against the benchmark established by "17_best," we'll analyze each FSM across the seven dimensions: State Coverage, Transition Coverage, Cyclomatic Complexity, Safety Mindset, Scalability, Assistance UX, and Action Set Alignment. The "17_best" FSM will serve as our benchmark, with perfect scores of 10 in each dimension. Let's evaluate each FSM:

### FSM "17_1" (ButlerRobotStairSafetyFSM)

1. **State Coverage**: 8/10. Covers essential states but lacks states for assessing child reactions and ensuring child safety, present in "17_best."
2. **Transition Coverage**: 7/10. Has clear transitions but lacks some depth in child monitoring and reaction assessment.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 6/10. Simpler structure with fewer interconnected states compared to "17_best."
4. **Safety Mindset**: 8/10. Prioritizes safety but lacks comprehensive risk assessment and ongoing monitoring.
5. **Scalability**: 7/10. Structured to allow extensions but not as versatile as "17_best."
6. **Assistance UX**: 7/10. Engages directly with the child but might not provide as nuanced interactions as "17_best."
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 9/10. Closely follows the industry-standard action set, with minor deviations.

**Overall Benchmark Score**: (8 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 9) / 7 ≈ 7.4/10

### FSM "17_2" (ButlerRobotFSM)

1. **State Coverage**: 6/10. Covers critical scenarios but lacks detailed child engagement and risk assessment states.
2. **Transition Coverage**: 6/10. Transitions are straightforward but miss finer state changes for continuous safety assessment.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 5/10. Less complex, missing the depth of states for thorough risk management.
4. **Safety Mindset**: 7/10. Focuses on immediate actions for safety but lacks ongoing risk assessment.
5. **Scalability**: 6/10. Can be expanded but may require significant changes for nuanced scenarios.
6. **Assistance UX**: 6/10. Direct child interaction is present, but lacks the continual monitoring and nuanced response of "17_best."
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 8/10. Mostly adheres to the standard action set with a few custom actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score**: (6 + 6 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 6 + 8) / 7 ≈ 6.3/10

### FSM "17_3" (ButlerRobotFSM)

1. **State Coverage**: 7/10. Includes diverse states but lacks some specific child safety assurance states.
2. **Transition Coverage**: 7/10. Good coverage, but lacks depth in ongoing child monitoring.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 7/10. Moderately complex with a good range of interconnected states.
4. **Safety Mindset**: 8/10. Strong focus on child safety, though it could be more proactive.
5. **Scalability**: 7/10. Flexible design, though some states might require significant changes for different contexts.
6. **Assistance UX**: 7/10. Considers child comfort and safety but might not be as responsive as "17_best."
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 8/10. Generally adheres to the standard action set but includes some additional actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score**: (7 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 8) / 7 ≈ 7.3/10

### FSM "17_4" (ButlerRobotHFSM)

1. **State Coverage**: 7/10. Includes key states but lacks some detailed monitoring and reaction assessment.
2. **Transition Coverage**: 8/10. Well-structured transitions, though some additional states for child monitoring could be added.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 6/10. Simpler than "17_best," potentially limiting its adaptability in complex situations.
4. **Safety Mindset**: 9/10. Strong emphasis on safety, slightly less comprehensive than "17_best."
5. **Scalability**: 8/10. Relatively adaptable, but might need modifications for more complex scenarios.
6. **Assistance UX**: 8/10. Good user experience, although it may lack the full contextual responsiveness of "17_best."
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 9/10. Stays close to the standard action set, with minimal deviations.

**Overall Benchmark Score**: (7 + 8 + 6 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 9) / 7 ≈ 7.9/10
