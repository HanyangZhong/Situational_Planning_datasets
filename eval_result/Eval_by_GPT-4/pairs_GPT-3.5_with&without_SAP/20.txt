Firstly, let's identify the states and actions in the scenarios.

For the butler robot FSM program 20_3, the states are INITIAL, ASSESS_SITUATION, REACH_EMERGENCY, ASSIST_ELDERLY, CALL_FOR_HELP, READY_TO_HELP, and, COMPLETE. The actions are is_elderly_in_distress, is_emergency_device_reachable, move_towards_emergency_device, help_elderly, call_for_help, and is_human_assistance_arrived.

For the butler robot FSM program 20_4, the states are INITIAL, ASSESS_DISTRESS, REACH_DEVICE, TAKE_DEVICE, ASSIST_PERSON, CHECK_EMERGENCY, and CALL_FOR_HELP. The actions are is_person_in_distress, reach, grip, assist, is_emergency, and call_for_help.

Here are the scores for each FSM program across the seven dimensions:

## FSM 20_3
1. State Coverage: 8. All states seem to be covered except for states that handle failure scenarios. 
2. Transition Coverage: 8. The majority of likely sequences are covered, though some edge cases may have been missed.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6. State interconnectivity is at an intermediate level, with possible room for improvement.
4. Safety Mindset: 9. The FSM attempts to guarantee safety with its focus on the emergency device and calling for help.
5. Scalability: 7. The FSM is modular and can be easily extended, though improvements could be made.
6. Assistance UX: 9. The FSM ensures the user experience is good by assisting the elderly person.
7. Action Set Alignment: 7. The FSM uses a significant number of actions from the defined action set, although it does introduce a few custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score for 20_3: (8+8+6+9+7+9+7)/7 = 7.7 (rounded to 1 decimal place)

## FSM 20_4
1. State Coverage: 9. All necessary states are represented, except the state for the arrival of human help.
2. Transition Coverage: 9. Nearly all state transitions are covered, but edge cases could be missed.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7. The FSM has a reasonable level of complexity, though it could be improved.
4. Safety Mindset: 10. Safety is prioritized, with the robot immediately responding to distress and calling for help.
5. Scalability: 8. The FSM could be extended to new contexts, but it would require some work.
6. Assistance UX: 9. The FSM provides a generally good user experience, though this could be more personalized.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8. Most of the actions are from the defined action set, but there are a few custom actions.

Overall Benchmark Score for 20_4: (9+9+7+10+8+9+8)/7 = 8.6 (rounded to 1 decimal place)

Kindly note that these scores are based on the given code and without any actual runtime observations, the estimated score could vary with an actual test run.
