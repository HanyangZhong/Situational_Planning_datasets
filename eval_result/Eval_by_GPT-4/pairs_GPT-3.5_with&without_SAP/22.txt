To evaluate the FSMs in "22_3" and "22_4" against the benchmark established by "22_best", I'll compare them across the seven dimensions you've mentioned. I'll then calculate their Overall Benchmark Scores based on these comparisons. Let's break it down for each FSM:

### 1. "22_3" FSM Evaluation

#### State Coverage
- **Score: 5/10**
- **Rationale**: "22_3" covers key states like assessing the situation and calling for help but lacks comprehensive states for managing a fallen person, like providing immediate assistance or monitoring until help arrives.

#### Transition Coverage
- **Score: 6/10**
- **Rationale**: It covers basic transitions like moving from assessing the situation to attempting to reach the button or calling for help, but lacks more nuanced transitions found in "22_best".

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- **Score: 3/10**
- **Rationale**: "22_3" has a simpler structure with fewer interconnected states, indicating lower cyclomatic complexity.

#### Safety Mindset
- **Score: 7/10**
- **Rationale**: While it focuses on reaching the button and calling for help, it doesn't explicitly address immediate safety measures like "22_best".

#### Scalability
- **Score: 6/10**
- **Rationale**: The FSM seems adaptable to similar scenarios but lacks the depth to easily extend to vastly different contexts.

#### Assistance UX
- **Score: 6/10**
- **Rationale**: The user experience is functional, focusing on practical solutions, but lacks the personalization and comfort aspects.

#### Action Set Alignment
- **Score: 8/10**
- **Rationale**: It mostly adheres to the action set vocabulary but misses out on some actions that could be beneficial in this scenario.

**Overall Benchmark Score for "22_3"**: \((5 + 6 + 3 + 7 + 6 + 6 + 8) / 7 \approx 5.86\)

### 2. "22_4" FSM Evaluation

#### State Coverage
- **Score: 4/10**
- **Rationale**: "22_4" has limited states compared to "22_best". It focuses on the button but misses other critical states for comprehensive assistance.

#### Transition Coverage
- **Score: 5/10**
- **Rationale**: The transitions are basic and do not encompass a wide range of potential situations a fallen pregnant woman might face.

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- **Score: 2/10**
- **Rationale**: Very low interconnectivity, indicating minimal complexity.

#### Safety Mindset
- **Score: 5/10**
- **Rationale**: Some focus on safety is evident, but it lacks a holistic approach to ensure the well-being of the individual.

#### Scalability
- **Score: 4/10**
- **Rationale**: The FSM is somewhat rigid and would need significant modifications to adapt to different scenarios.

#### Assistance UX
- **Score: 5/10**
- **Rationale**: The FSM is focused on the task but lacks the nuanced understanding of user needs and comfort.

#### Action Set Alignment
- **Score: 7/10**
- **Rationale**: It aligns with the action set vocabulary to a good extent, but not as comprehensively as "22_best".

**Overall Benchmark Score for "22_4"**: \((4 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 7) / 7 \approx 4.57\)

### Summary
- "22_3" seems to perform better overall than "22_4", especially in aspects of Safety Mindset and Action Set Alignment.
- However, both FSMs lag behind "22_best" in terms of State and Transition Coverage, as well as Scalability and Assistance UX, indicating areas for improvement.
