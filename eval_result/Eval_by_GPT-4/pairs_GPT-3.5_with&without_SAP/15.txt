Before I commence the analysis, I need to clarify that while I, as an AI, I do not run the code but I can perform an analysis based on the information provided in the code. Below is the evaluation:

FSM: 15_3

1. State Coverage: Coverage is relatively low, as it does not consider the cat's reactions, nor does it include states for more complex scenarios or conditions. Score: 5
2. Transition Coverage: There is a consistent coverage of the transitions. Each state is consistently followed by the situation assessment state. Score: 8
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM has a low state interconnectivity, with each state narrowly leading into the next. There are no multiple paths from each state. Score: 2
4. Safety Mindset: The FSM has some focus on safety, as it considers different hazards in the environment. However, it misses the interaction with the cat and other potential hazards. Score: 6
5. Scalability: The FSM is relatively easy to extend, as each state is self-contained and modular. Score: 7
6. Assistance UX: Only focuses on the environment and not the interaction with the pet/owner. Therefore, the user experience might feel rigid. Score: 4
7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM sticks relatively closely to the given action set, although there's no indication of which actions are part of this set in the code. Score: 6

Overall Benchmark Score for FSM 15_3: (5+8+2+6+7+4+6)/7 = 5.4

FSM: 15_4

1. State Coverage: This FSM shows improved state coverage, adding more states considering different hazards and checks. Score: 7
2. Transition Coverage: Transitions coverage is better, with assessments leading to specific action states. However, there's still room for more transitions. Score: 7.5
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: There's some increased complexity with the addition of several new states, but the FSM remains relatively straightforward and not densely interconnected. Score: 3.5
4. Safety Mindset: This FSM better considers safety, addressing more potential hazards. Score: 7
5. Scalability: It is relatively easy to extend this FSM, as each hazard has its dedicated state and function. Score: 7
6. Assistance UX: It still lacks interactions with the pet/owner, focusing mainly on the environment. Score: 5
7. Action Set Alignment: Similar to 15_3, this FSM mostly sticks to standard actions, though it introduces some new custom actions. Score: 7

Overall Benchmark Score for FSM 15_4: (7+7.5+3.5+7+7+5+7)/7 = 6.14

Note: Scoring of Safety Mindset, Assistance UX, and Action Set Alignment is particularly subjective without a definition of the action set and without seeing the FSM in operation. These scores are based on the available code alone.
