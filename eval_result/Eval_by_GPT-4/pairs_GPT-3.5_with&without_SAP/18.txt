Based on your provided codes and scoring dimensions, I will analyze the FSMs in the code "18_3" and "18_4". 

"18_3" FSM:

1. State Coverage: It has 6 states in total which covers the basic requirements of the child safety scenario including assessing the situation, engaging the child, pressuring the child, monitoring play, and calling for help. However, compared to the "18_best" FSM it lacks the state for securing the outlet. Therefore, the score is 7/10.
2. Transition Coverage: The FSM enables transitions from state to state based on whether the situation is dangerous or safe. Yet, it does not handle the transition back to the monitoring state if the child is not near the outlet in the engage child state, which is a significant omission. The score is 6/10.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: This FSM has a fair number of interconnected states, but it is not excessively complex. The score is 5/10.
4. Safety Mindset: This FSM is designed with a focus on children's safety, able to engage and pressure the child, and call for help. But there isn't any implementation for securing dangerous objects like an electrical outlet; hence the score is 7/10.
5. Scalability: The FSM has a relatively flexible structure that can be extended to more complex scenarios. The score is 7/10.
6. Assistance UX: While the system is primed for child safety, the engagement with the child could potentially be difficult, stressful, and not very user-friendly. The score is 6/10.
7. Action Set Alignment: Unfortunately, there are no specific actions defined in this FSM, and it doesn't seem to align particularly well with the provided set of actions. The score is 3/10.
The Overall Benchmark Score for "18_3" is the average of these ratings, which equals to 5.85/10.

"18_4" FSM:

1. State Coverage: All the required states are present in this FSM, including the one for covering the outlet to neutralize the danger. The score is 10/10.
2. Transition Coverage: The transitions between the states are comprehensive, and cover all the likely scenarios. The score is 9/10 due to lack of some minor transitions.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM is fairly complex with numerous transitions between the states. However, there is still a clear, logical flow. The score is 6/10.
4. Safety Mindset: This FSM has a notable focus on safety, including steps to cover the outlet and engage the child. The score is 10/10.
5. Scalability: The FSM can easily be scaled to include additional states if needed, making it highly scalable. The score is 9/10.
6. Assistance UX: The FSM engages the child and offers safe alternatives, potentially leading to a positive UX. However, there are no personalized interactions. The score is 8/10.
7. Action Set Alignment: This FSM includes some placeholder actions that match the provided set of actions, such as covering the outlet and calling for help. However, many actions are assumed but not defined in this sketch. The score is 6/10.
The Overall Benchmark Score for "18_4" is the average of these ratings, which equals to 8.29/10.
