Given the clarity of the code and the provided assessment criteria, I would review the code and provide the following analysis:

**FSM: 10_3**

1. State Coverage: 6/10
"10_3" covers most of necessary states - 'initial', 'assess', 'move obstacle', 'clear path', 'reach desk', 'task complete'. However, compared to "10_best", it does not have a 'call_family' and 'ensure_path_clear' state, which may be necessary in cases the bot cannot handle.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10
It provides transitions to cover most sequences, but there's no loop back to assessment after moving the obstacle that could be beneficial in case of subsequent obstacles or changes in the environment.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10
From 'initial' state, the finite state machine can only go to one following state, which indicates a simple and not densely interconnected state graph.

4. Safety Mindset: 6/10
The FSM displays fundamental safety considerations by providing clear states to deal with obstacle removal, yet it lacks the ability to call for help in case of complications.

5. Scalability: 7/10
The actions are encapsulated and separated in individual methods, which could be extended or overridden.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10
The UX provides clear transitions between states but is not contextual or personalized.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7/10
While most actions can be roughly translated into the predefined action set, actions such as 'dragging' and 'checking' are used which are not in the specified action list.

Overall Benchmark Score: (6 + 7 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 7) / 7 = 6.14

**FSM: 10_4**

1. State Coverage: 7/10
The 'ensure_path_clear' and 'call_family' states, as in "10_best", are missing in this FSM.

2. Transition Coverage: 7/10
It covers most sequences but lacks a process for reassessment for subsequent obstacles or changes environment after moving the obstacle.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10
Similar to "10_3", the FSM contains more states and slightly more transitions than "10_3" but is still not densely interconnected.

4. Safety Mindset: 6/10
The FSM has similar safety considerations to "10_3" but again lacks a state for calling for help.

5. Scalability: 7/10
The state transitions and action methods are clear and could be extended or overridden for scalability.

6. Assistance UX: 6/10
Although the FSM provides clear transitions, it lacks personalization and contextual responses.

7. Action Set Alignment: 7/10
This FSM also employs actions like 'lifting', 'lowering', and 'checking' which are not part of the predefined action set.

Overall Benchmark Score: (7 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 7) / 7 = 6.43

Both FSMs "10_3" and "10_4" show basic functional implementation of FSMs to help a person in a wheelchair navigate an obstacle within a room. Nonetheless, they could be improved upon to capture more depth and nuances in state coverage, transition coverage, and safety considerations. Both codes could be simplified further to decrease cyclomatic complexity and refined to better align with the predefined action set.
