Based on your request, let's evaluate both FSMs: "17_3" and "17_4" according to the seven dimensions and compare with the "17_best". 

First, let's look at "17_3":

1. State Coverage: The FSM has different states that denote the different steps the robot takes in ensuring child safety near the stairs. However, it lacks states related to communicating or interacting with the child. The states do cover the process to secure the stairs, though. Hence the score is 7/10.

2. Transition Coverage: The FSM covers transitions completely, going from one state to the next logically based on conditions. It keeps monitoring the child at the end of every action. Score: 10/10.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Each state has only one or two transitions. It's not dense, but the flow is clear and simple to follow. Score: 2/10.

4. Safety Mindset: It shows concern for the child's safety and takes measures to prevent the child from accessing the stairs. The score is 8/10 as it doesn't proactively distract the child.

5. Scalability: The states and transitions are well-defined, and extending functionality, such as adding additional child safety mechanisms, should be straightforward. Score: 9/10.

6. Assistance UX: The FSM lacks interactive states like communicating with the child or the residents. It majorly makes decisions and actions independently, hence 6/10.

7. Action Set Alignment: The actions are quite aligned with the defined action set vocabulary mentioned. Still, there are some instances where it refers to new actions not present in the vocabulary, such as the 'screwing' and 'turning doorknob actions.' Therefore, a score of 8/10.

Overall Benchmark Score for "17_3": (7+10+2+8+9+6+8)/7 ＞ 7.14/10.

Now, let's look at "17_4":

1. State Coverage: The FSM doesn't bring in states that correspond with the specific scenario of a child near the staircase. It seems to be more directed towards a gas leak scenario. Score: 2/10.

2. Transition Coverage: Though not suited for the given scenario, the FSM covers transitions logically within its context. Score: 8/10.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM's complexity is minimal as each state mostly leads to just one other state. Score: 1/10.

4. Safety Mindset: The FSM lacks action related to the child's safety in the provided context. However, it does showcase safety measures for a different situation, inferably a gas leak. Score: 2/10.

5. Scalability: The FSM appears scalable as it follows a structure that can be extended for other safety scenarios. Score: 7/10.

6. Assistance UX: The FSM is designed to intervene independently in potential emergencies, but is not interactive with humans. Score: 3/10.

7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM refers to actions not present in the action set vocabulary such as 'closing the gas valve' and 'opening the windows'. Score: 4/10.

Overall Benchmark Score for "17_4": (2+8+1+2+7+3+4)/7 ＞ 3.86/10. 

Please note that these scores were assigned based on the provided FSM code and the action set vocabulary in relation to the described scenario. The actions mentioned in both FSMs as placeholders should be replaced with actual implementation for a complete evaluation.
