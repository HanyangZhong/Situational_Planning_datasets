Evaluation of FSM in Code "14_3":

1. State Coverage: The provided FSM appears to cover the majority of necessary states well, such as initial assessment, engaging the cat, and removing toxic items. However, it does not describe how to handle a scenario if the cat doesn't get distracted by the robot and still tries to reach the toxic foods. The FSM should also include a state for continuous monitoring of the situation after removing the hazardous items. It scores 8/10.

2. Transition Coverage: The FSM transitions between states pretty well, but lacks the transition back to the 'INITIAL' state from 'ASSESS_CAT_DISTANCE' if the cat is not near the counter. This could potentially result in the robot getting stuck in the 'INITIAL' state without any route to reassess the situation. It scores 7/10.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Here the complexity seems to be within an acceptable range, not being too interconnected but each state logically follows given the scenario. Thus it scores 8/10.

4. Safety Mindset: The FSM clearly focuses on removing dangerous elements for the cat, showing a clear focus on safety. It scores 9/10. 

5. Scalability: The code can be easily extended to other situations as the state transitions are intuitive. However, we might need to adjust states or add even more according to different scenarios and this can make changes more complex. It scores 7/10.

6. Assistance UX: The UX seems to be fairly efficient, the actions are easy to understand but it lacks some error management scenarios. It scores 7/10.

7. Action Set Alignment: All actions seem to be taken from the defined action set vocabulary. There appear to be only a few custom actions included. It scores 9/10.

Overall Benchmark Score for "14_3": The scores across the seven dimensions average out to 7.9 out of 10.

Evaluation of FSM in Code "14_4":

1. State Coverage: This FSM covers the necessary states quite comprehensively. It confirms the cat's position and then distinguishes the scenarios where the cat is present on the counter or not. But it still lacks state for continual monitoring after the hazardous items are removed. Overall, it scores 9/10.

2. Transition Coverage: State transitions are well-defined. However, it also lacks a transition from 'CAT_NOT_ON_COUNTER' back to 'ASSESS_SITUATION'. Thus it scores 8/10.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM in this code has well-managed complexity with logically structured states and transitions. It scores 9/10.

4. Safety Mindset: It appears that safety has been well considered in this FSM design with appropriate help and actions to safeguard the cat. It scores 10/10. 

5. Scalability: The FSM seems to be scalable as the states and actions have been properly defined and categorized enabling easier extensions, as such it scores 8/10.

6. Assistance UX: The UX for this code will provide natural and personalized interactions. It scores 8/10.

7. Action Set Alignment: This FSM strictly uses actions from the provided set, so it scores 10/10.

Overall Benchmark Score for "14_4": The scores across the seven dimensions average out to 8.9 out of 10.
