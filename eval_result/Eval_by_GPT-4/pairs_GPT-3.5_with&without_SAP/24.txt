Let's evaluate the FSMs for the code "24_3" and "24_4" based on the benchmark set by "24_best". 

--- Code: "24_3" ---

State Coverage: Score - 6
The code covers the necessary states including the initial assessing of the situation, checking the safety of the toys, engaging the child and calling for help. However, it lacks a specific state to address the removal of unsafe toys, which is stated in "24_best".

Transition Coverage: Score - 6 
All states are linked and the FSM can transit between them, but if the toys are risky, it immediately calls for help without trying to remove threats.

Cyclomatic Complexity: Score - 5
The state-to-state transitions are fairly linear, with no explicit loops leading to minimal complexity.

Safety Mindset: Score - 5
The robot identifies unsafe toys and calls for assistance, but doesn't actively intervene to remove the hazard.

Scalability: Score - 7
Few states, each with clearly defined actions, makes it relatively easy to add or modify states in this FSM.

Assistance UX: Score - 7
The robot engages with the child and ensures their safety with minimal intervention, providing a comforting presence.

Action Set Alignment: Score - 3 
Actions for the evaluation of safety and interaction with the child are present, but critical actions such as removal of hazardous objects are missing.

Average Score for "24_3" : (6 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 7 + 3)/7 = 5.6

--- Code: "24_4" ---

State Coverage: Score - 8
The states include an idle state, assessing toys, warning the child, moving toys, monitoring play, and calling for assistance which ensures well-rounded state coverage. 

Transition Coverage: Score - 8 
There is a good sequence of transitions covering all logical possibilities including the transitioning from monitor play to either warning the child or calling for assistance.

Cyclomatic Complexity: Score - 6
There is some complexity due to the assessment of the toys and monitoring of the child, leading to several different next possible states.

Safety Mindset: Score - 8
The robot ensures safety by not only identifying but also addressing the hazards, warning the child, and moving potentially dangerous toys.

Scalability: Score - 7
The modular structure of the FSM and clear definition of states and transitions simplifies the process of expanding the FSM.

Assistance UX: Score - 7
The FSM allows for thorough interaction and safety measures, helping the child avoid hazardous situations.

Action Set Alignment: Score - 7 
Many actions from the list are in use. Still, some, like 'lifting' and 'lowering', could be defined better.

Average Score for "24_4" : (8 + 8 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 7)/7 = 7.3

In comparison to the "24_best" FSM that receives perfect 10s across the board, the "24_3" FSM scores lower due to the lack of proactive handling of the small toys posing a choking hazard. The "24_4" FSM shows better performance by actively removing hazard toys, but still lacks optimal state transitions and cyclomatic complexity.
