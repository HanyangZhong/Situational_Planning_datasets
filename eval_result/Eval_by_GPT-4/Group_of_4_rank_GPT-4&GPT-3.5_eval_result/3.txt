To evaluate the FSMs in the provided code snippets ("3_1", "3_2", "3_3", and "3_4") against the benchmark established by "3_best", we'll assess each FSM across seven dimensions: State Coverage, Transition Coverage, Cyclomatic Complexity, Safety Mindset, Scalability, Assistance UX, and Action Set Alignment. The scores will be given on a scale of 0-10 for each dimension, with "3_best" serving as the ideal benchmark with a score of 10 in each category.

### 1. "3_1" FSM Analysis

#### State Coverage
- "3_1" focuses on extinguishing the flame, preserving tea, and placing glasses. It covers the key states for the scene but lacks some depth in safety measures.
- **Score:** 7/10

#### Transition Coverage
- The FSM transitions are quite linear, transitioning from one state to the next based on the situation.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- This FSM is straightforward with minimal complexity.
- **Score:** 3/10

#### Safety Mindset
- While it addresses the flame, it lacks broader safety checks.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Scalability
- Somewhat scalable but could be more adaptable to other contexts.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Assistance UX
- The FSM seems to offer a good UX but could be more interactive or proactive.
- **Score:** 7/10

#### Action Set Alignment
- Aligns well with the action set but could incorporate more varied actions.
- **Score:** 7/10

#### Overall Benchmark Score
- Average Score: \((7+6+3+6+6+7+7)/7\)

### 2. "3_2" FSM Analysis

#### State Coverage
- Covers key states like checking the situation and removing the candle but lacks some states for comprehensive handling.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Transition Coverage
- Transitions are straightforward but lack dynamic response to varied scenarios.
- **Score:** 5/10

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- Moderately complex, with a few interconnected states.
- **Score:** 4/10

#### Safety Mindset
- Safety is a priority, especially in removing the candle.
- **Score:** 7/10

#### Scalability
- Decently scalable, though the design could be more flexible.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Assistance UX
- Functional UX but lacks depth in interaction and adaptability.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Action Set Alignment
- Aligns fairly well with the standard action set.
- **Score:** 7/10

#### Overall Benchmark Score
- Average Score: \((6+5+4+7+6+6+7)/7\)

### 3. "3_3" FSM Analysis

#### State Coverage
- Addresses multiple scenarios but could be more comprehensive in safety.
- **Score:** 7/10

#### Transition Coverage
- Good transitions but could be more interconnected for complex scenarios.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- Reasonably complex with several potential paths.
- **Score:** 5/10

#### Safety Mindset
- Safety is considered, but could be more proactive.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Scalability
- Can be extended but might require significant modifications for new contexts.
- **Score:** 5/10

#### Assistance UX
- Offers a reasonable UX but could improve in personalization.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Action Set Alignment
- Uses a variety of actions from the standard set.
- **Score:** 7/10

#### Overall Benchmark Score
- Average Score: \((7+6+5+6+5+6+7)/7\)

### 4. "3_4" FSM Analysis

#### State Coverage
- Covers essential states but lacks some depth in certain areas.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Transition Coverage
- Linear transitions with limited dynamic responses.
- **Score:** 5/10

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- Not highly complex; more straightforward paths.
- **Score:** 4/10

#### Safety Mindset
- Shows consideration for safety but could be more encompassing.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Scalability
- Moderately scalable, with some room for improvement.
- **Score:** 5/10

#### Assistance UX
- Provides a basic UX, but lacks depth in user interaction.
- **Score:** 5/10

#### Action Set Alignment
- Fairly aligned with the action set but could integrate more actions.
- **Score:** 6/10

#### Overall Benchmark Score
- Average Score: \((6+5+4+6+5+5+6)/7\)
