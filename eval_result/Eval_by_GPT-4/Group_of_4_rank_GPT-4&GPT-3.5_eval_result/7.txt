To evaluate the Finite State Machines (FSMs) in the provided code snippets against the benchmark established by "7_best", I will analyze each FSM across the seven dimensions you've outlined. The scoring will be on a scale of 0-10 for each dimension, where 10 represents the highest performance or alignment with the benchmark.

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **State Coverage**
2. **Transition Coverage**
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**
4. **Safety Mindset**
5. **Scalability**
6. **Assistance UX**
7. **Action Set Alignment**

### FSMs for Analysis:

- **7_1: ButlerRobotFSM**
- **7_2: ButlerRobotFSM**
- **7_3: ButlerRobotFSM**
- **7_4: ButlerRobotFSM**

### Evaluation:

#### 1. 7_1: ButlerRobotFSM

1. **State Coverage:** 7/10. Covers most required states but lacks some like 'SECURE_CORD' and 'MONITOR'.
2. **Transition Coverage:** 8/10. Well-connected but misses some transitions like returning to monitor after tasks.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 6/10. Reasonably interconnected but not as dense as the benchmark.
4. **Safety Mindset:** 7/10. Focuses on safety but less emphasis on continuous monitoring.
5. **Scalability:** 7/10. Structured for expansion, but certain areas could be better modularized.
6. **Assistance UX:** 6/10. Functional, but not as user-centric as the benchmark.
7. **Action Set Alignment:** 7/10. Mostly adheres to the action set but introduces some custom actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 7_1:** \(\frac{7+8+6+7+7+6+7}{7} \approx 6.9\)

#### 2. 7_2: ButlerRobotFSM

1. **State Coverage:** 6/10. Misses several states like 'ARRANGE_SHOES', 'STRAIGHTEN_RUG'.
2. **Transition Coverage:** 7/10. Good connections but lacks complex transitions.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 5/10. Simpler structure with fewer interconnected states.
4. **Safety Mindset:** 6/10. Addresses safety but not in a comprehensive manner.
5. **Scalability:** 6/10. Can be extended but might require significant restructuring.
6. **Assistance UX:** 5/10. Basic interaction, lacking in personalization.
7. **Action Set Alignment:** 8/10. Generally follows the action set with minimal deviations.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 7_2:** \(\frac{6+7+5+6+6+5+8}{7} \approx 6.1\)

#### 3. 7_3: ButlerRobotFSM

1. **State Coverage:** 8/10. Comprehensive but misses some specific states.
2. **Transition Coverage:** 7/10. Covers most scenarios but could be more interconnected.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 7/10. Moderately complex with multiple state relationships.
4. **Safety Mindset:** 8/10. Strong emphasis on safety and hazard detection.
5. **Scalability:** 8/10. Well-structured for adding new features.
6. **Assistance UX:** 7/10. More user-friendly but lacks full personalization.
7. **Action Set Alignment:** 9/10. Closely follows the predefined action set.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 7_3:** \(\frac{8+7+7+8+8+7+9}{7} \approx 7.7\)

#### 4. 7_4: ButlerRobotFSM

1. **State Coverage:** 5/10. Lacks many necessary states like 'CLEAN_PATHWAY', 'SECURE_CORD'.
2. **Transition Coverage:** 6/10. Simplistic transitions, misses complex scenarios.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 4/10. Less complex, fewer inter-state connections.
4. **Safety Mindset:** 5/10. Addresses safety but not as a primary focus.
5. **Scalability:** 5/10. Basic structure, significant modifications needed for scaling.
6. **Assistance UX:** 4/10. Very basic user interaction, not engaging.
7. **Action Set Alignment:** 6/10. Partially adheres to the action set but includes many custom actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 7_4:** \(\frac{5+6+4+5+5+4+6}{7} \approx 5.0\)

### Summary:

- **7_1** is a well-rounded FSM with good safety and
