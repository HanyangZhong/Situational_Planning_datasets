To evaluate and score the FSMs (Finite State Machines) in the codes "1_1", "1_2", "1_3", and "1_4" against the benchmark established by "1_best", we'll assess each FSM across the seven dimensions: State Coverage, Transition Coverage, Cyclomatic Complexity, Safety Mindset, Scalability, Assistance UX, and Action Set Alignment. I'll then calculate their Overall Benchmark Scores and compare these scores with the "1_best" FSM.

### FSM "1_1" - ButlerRobotBathroomHFSM

1. **State Coverage**: 7/10. Covers most states like assessing, drying, arranging, wiping, but lacks states for fog clearance or towel handling which are in "1_best".
2. **Transition Coverage**: 8/10. Smooth transitions, but lacks return to initial state after each action.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 6/10. Simpler than "1_best" with fewer interconnected states.
4. **Safety Mindset**: 7/10. Addresses safety but not as comprehensively as "1_best".
5. **Scalability**: 6/10. Somewhat extendable, but integration of new states might be challenging.
6. **Assistance UX**: 7/10. Adequate user experience but less natural compared to "1_best".
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 8/10. Mostly adheres to the action set, but with a few deviations.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 1_1**: \( \frac{7 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 8}{7} \) = 7.0/10.

### FSM "1_2" - CleanupRobotFSM

1. **State Coverage**: 6/10. Covers essential states, misses out on mirror fog and towel handling.
2. **Transition Coverage**: 6/10. Limited transitions, often returning to initial state.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 5/10. Less complex, straightforward state transitions.
4. **Safety Mindset**: 7/10. Shows some safety considerations but not thorough.
5. **Scalability**: 5/10. Modest scalability, adding new states could be cumbersome.
6. **Assistance UX**: 6/10. Functional but lacks the personalized touch of "1_best".
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 7/10. Generally follows the set, with a few exceptions.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 1_2**: \( \frac{6 + 6 + 5 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 7}{7} \) = 6.0/10.

### FSM "1_3" - BathroomButlerRobotFSM

1. **State Coverage**: 8/10. Broad coverage, but misses minor tasks.
2. **Transition Coverage**: 8/10. Well-connected states, though slightly less than "1_best".
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 7/10. Moderately complex, less interconnectivity.
4. **Safety Mindset**: 8/10. Good focus on safety, slightly below "1_best".
5. **Scalability**: 7/10. Decently scalable, some integration challenges.
6. **Assistance UX**: 8/10. Good UX, but not as refined as "1_best".
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 9/10. Very close adherence to the action set.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 1_3**: \( \frac{8 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 9}{7} \) = 7.9/10.

### FSM "1_4" - BathroomButler

1. **State Coverage**: 5/10. Lacks several key states like fog clearing, towel drying.
2. **Transition Coverage**: 6/10. Adequate transitions, but less comprehensive.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 4/10. Simpler, less dense state connections.
4. **Safety Mindset**: 6/10. Some safety features, but not as thorough.
5. **Scalability**: 4/10. Limited scalability, rigid structure.
6. **Assistance UX**: 5/10. Basic UX, less intuitive than "1_best".
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 6/10. Moderate alignment, several deviations from the set.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 1_4**: \( \frac{5 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6}{7} \) = 5.1/10.

### Comparison Summary
Comparing these scores with "1_best", it's clear that:

- "1_3" is the closest in performance to "1_best", with strong state and transition coverage, safety mindset, and action
