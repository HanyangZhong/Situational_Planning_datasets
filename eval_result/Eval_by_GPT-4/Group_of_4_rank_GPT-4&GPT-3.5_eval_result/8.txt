To evaluate the FSMs in the code snippets "8_1", "8_2", "8_3", and "8_4" against the benchmark set by "8_best", I'll assess each one across the seven dimensions: State Coverage, Transition Coverage, Cyclomatic Complexity, Safety Mindset, Scalability, Assistance UX, and Action Set Alignment. Let's go through them one by one.

### 1. **8_1**: ButlerRobotHFSM

1. **State Coverage**: **7/10** - Covers key states like assessing the situation and securing knives, but lacks some finer states like final checks or monitoring.
2. **Transition Coverage**: **7/10** - Good transitions but could be more detailed, especially in handling varied situations.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: **5/10** - Simpler interconnectivity, lacking in complexity compared to "8_best".
4. **Safety Mindset**: **8/10** - Prioritizes safety by securing knives but lacks continuous monitoring.
5. **Scalability**: **6/10** - Reasonably extendable but might struggle with complex scenarios.
6. **Assistance UX**: **7/10** - Direct in approach but not as nuanced or contextual as "8_best".
7. **Action Set Alignment**: **8/10** - Mostly adheres to the action set vocabulary but includes a few extra actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 8_1**: \(\frac{7 + 7 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 8}{7} \approx 6.9\)

### 2. **8_2**: ButlerRobotFSM

1. **State Coverage**: **6/10** - Adequate state coverage but lacks comprehensive handling of the kitchen environment.
2. **Transition Coverage**: **6/10** - Transitions are present but not fully elaborated.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: **6/10** - Moderately complex with more connections.
4. **Safety Mindset**: **7/10** - Focuses on knife safety but misses broader safety checks.
5. **Scalability**: **5/10** - Moderate scalability, may need significant adjustments for different contexts.
6. **Assistance UX**: **6/10** - Functional but lacks personalized or contextual interactions.
7. **Action Set Alignment**: **7/10** - Generally adheres to the action set but deviates occasionally.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 8_2**: \(\frac{6 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 7}{7} \approx 6.1\)

### 3. **8_3**: ButlerRobotFSM

1. **State Coverage**: **5/10** - Covers basic scenarios but misses several important states.
2. **Transition Coverage**: **5/10** - Basic transitions, lacks depth and breadth.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: **4/10** - Less complex, straightforward state connections.
4. **Safety Mindset**: **6/10** - Addresses safety to an extent but not as comprehensively.
5. **Scalability**: **4/10** - Limited in scalability, requires more flexible design.
6. **Assistance UX**: **5/10** - Basic UX, lacks intuitive or engaging interactions.
7. **Action Set Alignment**: **6/10** - Mostly follows the set, but could be more aligned.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 8_3**: \(\frac{5 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 6}{7} \approx 5.0\)

### 4. **8_4**: ButlerRobotHFSM

1. **State Coverage**: **6/10** - Decent coverage but not as comprehensive as "8_best".
2. **Transition Coverage**: **6/10** - Adequate transitions, but could be more interconnected.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: **5/10** - Somewhat simplistic, lacking intricate state connections.
4. **Safety Mindset**: **7/10** - Good focus on safety, but not as proactive.
5. **Scalability**: **6/10** - Moderately scalable, but could be improved.
6. **Assistance UX**: **7/10** - Reasonable UX, but lacks the personal touch of "8_best".
7. **Action Set Alignment**: **8/10** - Largely adheres to the action set with minor deviations.

**Overall Benchmark Score for 8_4**: \(\frac{6 + 6 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 8}{7} \approx 6.4\)

### Summary
- **8_1** is quite comprehensive but slightly lacks in complexity and detailed safety measures.
- **8_2** shows moderate
