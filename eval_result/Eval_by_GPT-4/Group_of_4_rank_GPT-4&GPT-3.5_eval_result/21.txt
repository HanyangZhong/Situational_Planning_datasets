To evaluate and score the FSMs "21_1", "21_2", "21_3", and "21_4" against the benchmark established by "21_best", I'll assess each FSM across the seven dimensions you provided: State Coverage, Transition Coverage, Cyclomatic Complexity, Safety Mindset, Scalability, Assistance UX, and Action Set Alignment. The "21_best" FSM will be considered the ideal standard with perfect scores (10s) in each dimension.

### FSM "21_1"

1. **State Coverage**: 8
   - Covers most necessary states but lacks detailed injury assessment and monitoring states.
2. **Transition Coverage**: 7
   - Good transition coverage, but could improve by adding transitions back to monitoring after calling for help.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 6
   - Fairly interconnected, but not as complex as "21_best".
4. **Safety Mindset**: 9
   - Prioritizes safety by immediately reaching the button, but lacks ongoing monitoring.
5. **Scalability**: 7
   - Scalable but less adaptable to new scenarios compared to "21_best".
6. **Assistance UX**: 8
   - Good UX, but lacks the continual monitoring and reassessment present in "21_best".
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 7
   - Mostly aligns with the action set vocabulary but lacks some actions like 'monitoring' and 'assessing'.

**Overall Benchmark Score**: \( \frac{8 + 7 + 6 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 7}{7} \approx 7.4 \)

### FSM "21_2"

1. **State Coverage**: 7
   - Covers essential states but lacks detailed injury assessment.
2. **Transition Coverage**: 6
   - Good basic transitions, but lacks complexity and re-evaluation loops.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 5
   - Less complex, with fewer states and transitions.
4. **Safety Mindset**: 8
   - Good safety features but lacks detailed assessment and monitoring.
5. **Scalability**: 6
   - Less adaptable to different scenarios due to fewer states.
6. **Assistance UX**: 7
   - Decent UX but less personalized and adaptive.
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 6
   - Aligns reasonably with the action set but misses some actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score**: \( \frac{7 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 6}{7} \approx 6.4 \)

### FSM "21_3"

1. **State Coverage**: 6
   - Covers key states but lacks injury assessment and proper monitoring.
2. **Transition Coverage**: 5
   - Basic transitions with less emphasis on state re-evaluation.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 4
   - Simpler structure, less interconnected.
4. **Safety Mindset**: 7
   - Focuses on safety but lacks continuous monitoring.
5. **Scalability**: 5
   - Limited scalability due to simpler state structure.
6. **Assistance UX**: 6
   - Functional but less nuanced in user experience.
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 5
   - Aligns partially but misses several actions from the set.

**Overall Benchmark Score**: \( \frac{6 + 5 + 4 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 5}{7} \approx 5.4 \)

### FSM "21_4"

1. **State Coverage**: 7
   - Adequately covers important states but lacks comprehensive injury assessment.
2. **Transition Coverage**: 6
   - Sufficient transitions but lacks complex loops for re-evaluation.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: 5
   - Simpler than "21_best", with fewer interconnected states.
4. **Safety Mindset**: 8
   - Prioritizes immediate assistance but lacks ongoing reassessment.
5. **Scalability**: 6
   - Moderately scalable but not as flexible as "21_best".
6. **Assistance UX**: 7
   - Good user experience but lacks depth in interactions.
7. **Action Set Alignment**: 6
   - Mostly aligns with the action set but lacks some actions.

**Overall Benchmark Score**: \( \frac{7 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 6}{7} \approx 6.4 \)

These scores reflect the relative performance of each FSM compared to the "21_best" benchmark, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in the given scenario.
