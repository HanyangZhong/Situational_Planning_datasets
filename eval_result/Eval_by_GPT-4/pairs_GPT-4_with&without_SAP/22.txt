Assessment of FSM "22_3":

1. State Coverage: Score - 6
   The FSM "22_3" covers some of the essential states like assessing the situation, reaching the emergency button, pressing the button and calling for help. However, it lacks other states such as providing immediate assistance to the woman, monitoring her condition or providing comfort, which were part of the "22_best" FSM. 

2. Transition Coverage: Score -7 
   All states in "22_3" are connected and the transitions cover the specified sequence in the scenario, although the transitions are not as fully covered as in "22_best". 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Score - 5
   The interconnectivity is moderate. State changes depend on the conditions set in each state, but it is not as densely interconnected as "22_best".

4. Safety Mindset: Score - 7
   Safety is considered in states like 'ASSESS_SITUATION', 'REACH_BUTTON', 'PRESS_BUTTON', and explicit 'CALL_FOR_HELP'. However, there is not as much emphasis on safety as in "22_best".

5. Scalability: Score - 6
   The code is moderately extendable, and new states or transitions could be added. However, the current architecture might require significant changes for considerable extensions.

6. Assistance UX: Score - 5
   User experience is somewhat natural as the robot is programmed to respond based on the woman's condition, but it still appears robotic and lack personalized touch.

7. Action Set Alignment: Score - 7
   The actions within the states align fairly well with the action set vocabulary, but they are not as exhaustive or specific as in "22_best".

Overall Benchmark Score - 6.3 (average)



Assessment of FSM "22_4":

1. State Coverage: Score - 8
   Compared to "22_best", FSM "22_4" has a fairly comprehensive coverage of states. It covers the essential states and includes the woman's diagnosis and comfort provision which were missing in "22_3".

2. Transition Coverage: Score - 8
   All states in '22_4' are connected, as in '22_best', covering a natural sequence of events in the scenario.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Score - 7 
   The state transitions in '22_4' is less complex compared to ＆22_best＊, since each state in '22_4' has fewer immediately following states. 

4. Safety Mindset: Score - 8
   The FSM "22_4" includes states that prioritize the woman's safety and health conditions, and actively responds to emergencies.

5. Scalability: Score - 7
   The FSM structure of '22_4' is scalable and more contexts could be added to the scenario.

6. Assistance UX: Score - 8
   The FSM "22_4" provides a more contextual and personalized experience to the user. 

7. Action Set Alignment: Score - 8
   The actions described in '22_4' fairly align with the action set vocabulary provided and provide a comprehensive approach to the home-assistance scenario.

Overall Benchmark Score - 7.7 (average)

These scores and comments are according to my evaluation of both FSM's against the "22_best". Further improvement in FSM '22_3' and '22_4' can be made to closely align them with '22_best', thereby improving overall efficiency of the scenario.
