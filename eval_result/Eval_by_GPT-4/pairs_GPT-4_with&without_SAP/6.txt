Sure, I will now begin scoring FSMs in the code "6_3" and "6_4" against the benchmark "6_best" across all seven dimensions. 

1. **State Coverage**

**6_3 FSM:**

The '6_3' FSM manages to include various necessary states (7 states: INITIAL, CHECKING_ROOM, PICKING_UP_PRODUCTS, RECAP_BOTTLES, CLEAN_MESS, ARRANGE_SHELVES, CLOSE_DOOR) covering the crucial aspects like checking the room, picking up products, recapping bottles, cleaning mess, arranging shelves, and closing the door. However, it does not have a state for calling for help in case the bot can't handle the situation, unlike '6_best'. So, its State Coverage score would be 8.

**6_4 FSM:**

Similar to '6_3', '6_4' also goes through a series of states matching the '6_best' states such as INITIAL, ASSESS_SITUATION, CLEAN_MESS, SECURE_CHEMICALS, NEUTRALIZE_RISK, MONITOR_ROOM, CALL_FOR_HELP. It goes a step further and includes a state for neutralizing the risk besides just cleaning up the mess and securing the chemical. Therefore, it covers all the necessary states. So, its state coverage score would be 10.

2. **Transition Coverage**

**6_3 FSM:**

In the '6_3' FSM, transitions seem to cover all likely sequences that one would follow in this circumstance. It does not appear to have disconnected subgraphs. Therefore, it would receive a Transition Coverage score of 10.

**6_4 FSM:**

If we look at the '6_4' FSM, it＊s clear that the sequence of transitions from one state to another is logical and covers the necessary steps in resolving the situation presented. It's transitions seem to be all connected with no apparent disconnected subgraphs. Therefore, it would receive a Transition Coverage score of 10.

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**

**6_3 FSM:**

In the '6_3' FSM, the transitions between states are straightforward. It follows a linear path without much complexity. Therefore, it has a low cyclomatic complexity. It would score a 2 for Cyclomatic Complexity.

**6_4 FSM:**

Similar to '6_3', the '6_4' FSM also follows a straightforward path of state transitions, making it relatively easy to predict its behavior. Hence, it also has low cyclomatic complexity. So it scores a 2 for Cyclomatic Complexity.

4. **Safety Mindset**

**6_3 FSM:**

In '6_3', the FSM does attend to the cleaning up of mess and securing of open cleaning products. But it does not have any explicit state for calling outside help in case the bot can't make the area safe again. So, it gets a safety mindset score of 7.

**6_4 FSM:**

The '6_4' FSM not only attends to the cleaning and securement of dangerous items, but also adds a reminder to prevent future occurrences and includes a call for help state for scenarios it can't handle. This shows a higher safety mindset, so it scores a 10 on safety mindset.

5. **Scalability**

**6_3 FSM:**

The '6_3' FSM looks relatively easy to extend to new contexts, as it follows a linear path, making it easier to extend or modify each state individually. Hence, for Scalability it would score an 8.

**6_4 FSM:**

Similar to '6_3', the '6_4' FSM also appears easy to extend to new contexts. Each state deals with distinct actions that might be easier to modify for new scenarios. Its structure is relatively simple and shouldn＊t be an issue to adapt to new situations. Hence, for Scalability, it scores an 8.

6. **Assistance UX**

**6_3 FSM:**

The '6_3' FSM does go through the steps needed to make the situation safe again, but it does not include any user interaction, such as reminders for future safety or asking for human help, so it scores a 6 in assistance UX.

**6_4 FSM:**

The '6_4' FSM not only cleans up and secures the area but also includes a reminder to keep chemicals out of reach, showing an intent to personalize and make the assistant's interactions natural. So, it gets a score of 8 in assistance UX.

7. **Action Set Alignment**

**6_3 FSM:**

The '6_3' FSM mostly uses actions from the set vocabulary with actions like checking, collecting, gripping, replacing, grabbing, mopping, and others. So, it scores a 9 for action set alignment.

**6_4 FSM:**

The '6_4' FSM also strictly uses actions from the set vocabulary like checking, monitoring, grasping, mopping, releasing, gripping, lifting, closing, lowering, reminding, and calling. So, it also scores 9 for action set alignment.

Let's calculate Overall Benchmark Score:

**6_3 FSM:**
Add up all the scores (8+10+2+7+8+6+9) divided by the total number of categories (7), the Overall Benchmark Score would be 7.14.

**6_4 FSM:**
Similarly, for '6_4' FSM we add all the scores (10+10+2+10+8+8+9) divided by 7, we get an Overall Benchmark Score of 8.14.
