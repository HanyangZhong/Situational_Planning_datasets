Analysis of The FSMs in Code "18_3":

State Coverage: The FSM seems to cover all the necessary states such as assessing the situation, removing child, covering outlet, monitoring the room, and calling for help when needed. These states are fundamental in ensuring the safety of the child when playing around an uncovered outlet. So, given that the FSM includes these states, it would be safe to give it a score of 8/10 here. Points are deducted because it lacks a state to ensure the child remains safe and distracted once removed from danger, unlike the `ENSURE_CHILD_SAFETY` state in the model FSM '18_best'.

Transition Coverage: The transitions between states seem logical and fairly well-structured. From initial assessment of the situation, to taking action on any potential hazards, to then monitoring the room for any changes. However, it lacks specific transition if the child is not near the outlet, just transitioning to the monitor room state. It gives the FSM a score of 7/10 for this dimension.

Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM does not seem to have a high cyclomatic complexity, with many states having only one or two immediately following states. The minimal complexity might cause some scenarios to be overlooked. Therefore, it receives a score of 5/10.

Safety Mindset: The FSM has a reasonable safety mindset. It incorporates states that check for dangerous situations (assess_situation), attempts to move the child from danger (remove_child), covers the outlet (cover_outlet), and calls for help if needed (call_for_help). It's missing a state that ensures the child remains secure, so for this, it receives 7/10.

Scalability: This FSM is easy to extend for new situations and easily adapt to new settings. Further states and transitions could be added without much difficulty. Therefore, it scores 8/10 on the scalability dimension.

Assistance UX: This FSM attempts to provide a smooth experience by assessing the situation and taking appropriate action. However, it lacks states and transitions for engaging with the child in a gentler, potentially more pleasant way like the 'GENTLY_DISTRACT_CHILD' in the model FSM '18_best'. Therefore, it scores 6/10.

Action Set Alignment: Most of the actions performed by this FSM like lifting, placing, grasping, checking, monitoring and calling for help are included in the given action set vocabulary. However, the FSM's lift_child and place_child_safely actions aren't explicitly defined in the action set vocabulary. Therefore, it scores 7/10.

To calculate the overall benchmark score for FSM "18_3", we would then average these seven scores: 

(8 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 + 7) / 7 = 6.86

Therefore, FSM "18_3" receives an Overall Benchmark Score of 6.86/10.

Analysis of The FSMs in Code "18_4":

State Coverage: This FSM covers all the important states: checking the situation, engaging the child, covering the outlet, and monitoring the room. However, unlike FSM '18_best', it lacks a state to call for help if the situation can't be handled, reducing its score. For state coverage it receives a score of 7/10.

Transition Coverage: The FSM has complete coverage of state transitions. The connectivity is evident and follows a logical and sequential pattern. As such, it receives a score of 8/10.

Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM in question does not display a high degree of cyclomatic complexity, with only a few states having multiple subsequent states. Consequently, it gets a score of 5/10 in terms of its cyclomatic complexity.

Safety Mindset: This FSM takes safety very seriously, removing potential dangers and engaging the child in a safe manner. It misses out on the additional safety measure of calling for assistance if required, a state present in '18_best'. Its score for Safety Mindset is 8/10.

Scalability: This FSM shows good scalability. Additional states and transitions could be added as required for new situations, a feature that earns it an 8/10 score.

Assistance UX: The FSM in question displays a good understanding of the user experience, employing states which not only monitor and rectify hazards but also actively engage the child in safer, more pleasant play. It scores 8/10 for assistance UX.

Action Set Alignment: Most of the actions executed by the FSM, such as checking, monitoring, collecting, placing down, etc., are in line with the given action set vocabulary, giving it an alignment score of 8/10.

The overall benchmark score for FSM "18_4" is calculated by finding the mean of these seven scores: 

(7 + 8 + 5 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8) / 7 = 7.43

Consequently, the FSM "18_4" receives an Overall Benchmark Score of 7.43/10.

Although both alternatives have their merits, FSM "18_4" is more aligned with '18_best' and scores higher overall, making it the superior choice despite some room for improvement.
