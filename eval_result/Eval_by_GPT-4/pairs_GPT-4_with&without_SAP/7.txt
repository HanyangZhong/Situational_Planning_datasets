Alright, let's break down each FSM by the dimensions:

FSM "7_3":

1. State Coverage: 7. Code '7_3' lacks states for dealing in particular with the rug and the lamp cord. The FSM of '7_3' also does not include monitors as the FSM of '7_best'. 

2. Transition Coverage: 6. The code '7_3' needs one more transition between the 'PICKUP_ITEMS' and 'ASSESS_SITUATION' states like '7_best' to allow a re-check after each cleanup action.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6. The structure in the FSM '7_3' is notably isotropic and relatively incomplex when compared to the dense, interconnected web of '7_best' FSM.

4. Safety Mindset: 8. FSM '7_3' exhibits a good safety mindset. However, it lacks a state for securing lamp cords, potentially causing a tripping hazard.

5. Scalability: 7. The FSM '7_3' has simple structured transitions and states, which makes it easier to modify and extend. However, due to its lack of minor states, it may require more effort to scale.

6. Assistance UX: 7. Code '7_3' provides a simpler FSM structure, which may be easier for users to understand and interact with. However, the user experience might not be as fluid and adaptable as in '7_best'.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8. The code '7_3' sticks mostly to the defined action set. It misses few actions like 'unfolding', 'arranging', and 'monitoring' which were used in '7_best'.

Overall Benchmark Score for FSM "7_3" = (7+6+6+8+7+7+8)/7 = 7.00

FSM "7_4":

1. State Coverage: 9. FSM '7_4' covers almost all necessary states described in '7_best', except for the monitoring state.

2. Transition Coverage: 7. The state transitions in '7_4' do not cover as many sequences as those in '7_best'. A loop to assess the situation after each action is needed.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 8. The FSM '7_4' is a bit more complex as it has more interconnected states and transitions when compared to '7_3', but it is still not as densely connected as '7_best'.

4. Safety Mindset: 9. The FSM '7_4' pays special attention to each detail, including securing the lamp cord and the rug, and will call for help if needed.

5. Scalability: 9. '7_4' provides a detailed organization for complex situations, thus it shows good adaptation for expansions and modifications.

6. Assistance UX: 9. This FSM provides a more personalized and natural user experience by covering a large number of actions and situations.

7. Action Set Alignment: 10. '7_4' is strictly making use of actions within the predefined list, focusing on executing them effectively in the given scenario.

Overall Benchmark Score for FSM "7_4" = (9+7+8+9+9+9+10)/7 = 8.71

The ratings are subjective, based on my understanding of the codes and may vary depending on the specific requirements and use cases.
