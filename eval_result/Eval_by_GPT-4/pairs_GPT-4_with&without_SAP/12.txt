To evaluate the given FSMs, let's consider each code and analyze it across seven dimensions:

1. State Coverage
2. Transition Coverage
3. Cyclomatic Complexity
4. Safety Mindset
5. Scalability
6. Assistance UX
7. Action Set Alignment

Note: For all evaluations, a score of 10 exhibits exceptional performance within the criteria, while a score of 0 reveals significant limitations.

**Code 12_3 Analysis**

1. State Coverage: The FSM covers necessary states to monitor, assess, and intervene. This covers assessing the situation, clearing hazards, adjusting furniture, and monitoring the space. However, it does not provide states for identifying human safety, such as spotting if the woman falls or needs help. Score: 7.

2. Transition Coverage: Transitions are well defined, with the FSM moving from initial to assessing the environment, then healing with hazards found, then returning to monitoring. However, the absence of real-world complications affects the score. Score: 8.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM is simple and not densely interconnected, with clear paths leading linearly from one state to the other. Score: 3.

4. Safety Mindset: The FSM is tailored towards ensuring a clutter-free environment, but it does not consider human safety parameters like monitoring the woman's movement and assisting if she falls. Score: 6.

5. Scalability: The FSM is built modularly, allowing for the addition of more states. However, it fails to handle more complex scenarios or additional actions like assisting the woman. Score: 5.

6. Assistance UX: While the FSM does a competent job of maintaining a safe environment, it struggles to provide a personalized and natural human-friendly interaction. Score: 6.

7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM mostly uses defined methods such as `checking`, `grasping, ``lifting`, and `placing_down`. However, there is room for more actions from the given vocabulary. Score: 7. 

Overall Benchmark Score for 12_3: (7+8+3+6+5+6+7)/7 = 6.0

**Code 12_4 Analysis**

1. State Coverage: This FSM focuses on assessing the situation, removing clutter, fixing the rug, and monitoring the woman's movement, which align with the requirements. However, it lacks a state for when the woman is distressed or in danger. Score: 8.

2. Transition Coverage: The FSM has well-defined transitions between states, covering the necessary sequences of actions for this scenario. Score: 9.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM is straightforward, each state having a logical following and not densely interconnected. Score: 3.

4. Safety Mindset: FSM reflects safety behaviors like removing clutter, fixing the rug, and monitoring movement. However, it doesn't react when the woman is in danger. Score: 7.

5. Scalability: The FSM structure seems flexible and able to accommodate new scenarios, but it lacks response to unexpected real-world situations. Score: 6.

6. Assistance UX: This FSM does better at supporting UX by not only removing hazards but also continuously monitoring the woman's movements. It, however, lacks human-robot interaction. Score: 7.

7. Action Set Alignment: This FSM employs actions like `checking`, `collecting`, `grasping`, `transporting`, and `placing_down` from the predefined actions, but it could involve more actions. Score: 8. 

Overall Benchmark Score for 12_4: (8+9+3+7+6+7+8)/7 = 6.9

Both FSMs could benefit from incorporating states/actions responsive to the woman's safety, beyond merely maintaining a clean environment.
