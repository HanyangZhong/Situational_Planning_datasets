Let's start with evaluating FSM 20_3 using the seven specified dimensions:

1. **State Coverage**: FSM 20_3 includes states like monitoring the elderly, retrieving and bringing the emergency device, activating the device, and calling for help. However, the FSM doesn't include a state for assisting human helpers, which is present in FSM 20_best. Therefore the score might be 8 out of 10.

2. **Transition Coverage**: This FSM covers most necessary transitions like moving from monitoring the elderly to retrieving the emergency device but lacks the transition back to monitoring the elderly after the emergency is handled. So, the score could be 7 out of 10.

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: FSM 20_3 has minimal cyclomatic complexity, as there are no interconnected states, each state leads directly to the next. It is simple to understand but doesn't adapt to fluctuating situations, such as the emergency being resolved and the robot needing to return to monitoring. Thus, the score would be 2 out of 10.

4. **Safety Mindset**: In FSM 20_3, the robot detects when the elderly person is in distress, retrieves the emergency device, uses it, and calls for help. It acts in the safest interest of the elderly person. Hence, the score is 9 out of 10.

5. **Scalability**: The structure of this FSM makes adding new states or transitions relatively easy since each state leads to a defined next state. It provides a solid basis for an extended FSM, so the score could be 8 out of 10.

6. **Assistance UX**: FSM's UX is relatively rigid and robotic, with little input from the elderly person after initially detecting distress. This may not provide the best user experience. The score could be 6 out of 10.

7. **Action Set Alignment**: FSM 20_3 aligns well with the action set vocabulary, utilizing actions including monitoring, reaching, gripping, transporting, pressing, and calling. A score of 8 could be suitable.

The Overall Benchmark Score for FSM 20_3 would be the average of these individual scores, resulting (on average) in a score of approximately 6.9/10 which rounds up to 7.

Next, for FSM 20_4:

1. **State Coverage**: FSM 20_4 closely mirrors FSM 20_best. It includes states for performing initial assessments, getting the device if it's unreachable, delivering the device, conducting another assessment, and then calling for help if necessary. Therefore, the score can be 9 out of 10.

2. **Transition Coverage**: FSM 20_4 covers all possible transitions. It goes back to the INITIAL state once the emergency has been handled and is ready to reassess the situation. Hence, provide a score of 10.

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: FSM 20_4 also has a minimal cyclomatic complexity. There's one instance in which one of the states has two potential following states, but outside of that, it's fairly straight forward. Thus, the score would be 3 out of 10.

4. **Safety Mindset**: The FSM is specifically designed to perceive and suitably respond to an emergency situation ensuring the safety of the elderly person. Giving it a score of 10 would be appropriate.

5. **Scalability**: FSM 20_4 has a solid framework that can be extended easily for added stages or transitions. Hence, a score of 8 out of 10 would fit.

6. **Assistance UX**: This FSM includes checks on whether the person has been able to press the emergency button, ensuring a better UX. Therefore, a score of 8 could be appropriate.

7. **Action Set Alignment**: FSM 20_4 uses actions like checking, reaching, gripping, lowering, transporting, releasing, pressing, and calling from the action set vocabulary, aligning well with it. It results in a score of 9.

The Overall Benchmark Score for FSM 20_4 is an average of these individual scores, approximately 8.1/10, that rounds up to a score of 8. 

It appears that FSM 20_4 provides a more comprehensive and safer solution compared to FSM 20_3.
