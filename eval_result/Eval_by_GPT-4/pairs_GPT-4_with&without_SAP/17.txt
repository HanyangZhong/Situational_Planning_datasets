Sure, I'm going to evaluate the FSM in "17_3" and "17_4" using the established benchmark by "17_best". Let's analyze the two codes using the seven dimensions:

1. FSM in "17_3":
    - State Coverage: The FSM covers a significant number of necessary states. However, it lacks a state to monitor the environment, which "\5.
    - Transition Coverage: Transitions between states are fairly well covered. However, not all possibilities seem to be accounted for overall score: 7.
    - Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM is not overly complex, with individual states following a predictable path. Score: 6.
    - Safety Mindset: The FSM demonstrates a focus on safety by lifting the child away from the stairs and calling for help in various situations, but its direct physical intervention may pose some risks. Score: 7.
    - Scalability: The code workflow is simple and organized but might need adaptation for different scenarios. Score: 6.
    - Assistance UX: The FSM does not contain user interaction or an UX state; however, it is focused on the child safety. Score: 7.
    - Action Set Alignment: The FSM uses many of the defined action sets such as monitoring, checking, calling etc. Score: 8.
    Overall Benchmark Score Average 7 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 8) / 7 = 6.1 out of 10. 

2. FSM in "17_4":
    - State Coverage: The FSM provides a good coverage of necessary states including assessing the situation, protecting the child, securing the staircase, and calling for help. Score: 8.
    - Transition Coverage: The FSM seems to address most possible state transitions making it a fairly comprehensive solution. Score: 8.
    - Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM is well-structured and not overly complex. Individual states have specific next steps making it easy to follow the logic. Score: 7.
    - Safety Mindset: The FSM indicates an excellent focus on protecting the child and securing the staircase contributing to the child safety. Score: 9.
    - Scalability: This code is particularly organized and easy to follow suggesting that adding states or modifying existing ones would be straightforward. Score: 8.
    - Assistance UX: Similar to "17_3", this FSM does not incorporate any user interaction states, but it demonstrates a focus on ensuring child safety. Score: 7.
    - Action Set Alignment: The FSM strictly uses actions from the defined list, including monitoring, checking, gripping, transporting, calling etc. Score: 9.
    Overall Benchmark Score Average (8 + 8 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 9) / 7 = 8.0 out of 10.

In comparison with the '17_best.txt' FSM, both FSM "17_3" and FSM "17_4" demonstrate good compatibility with the ideal. However, FSM "17_4" appears to edge out FSM "17_3" in almost all assessment dimensions, possibly making it the more robust solution for home safety scenarios. Please note that these scores are approximations and real-world testing may be needed for precise tuning.
