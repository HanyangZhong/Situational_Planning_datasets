Analysis of FSM "3_3":

1. State Coverage: The FSM covers four states (Initial, Check situation, Remove candle, Call for help). However, it does not consider the possibility of verifying success, failing to check whether the candle is actually extinguished or removed. It also lacks states for handling action failure. So, I would rate it a 6 out of 10.

2. Transition Coverage: The FSM transitions represent a non-twisting path of execution, but they lack an exit transition if everything is safe or if an action succeeds. This is a significant issue, thus the score is 4.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: This FSM is relatively simple, with only a few states and straightforward transitions. The cyclomatic complexity is therefore low. Score - 2.

4. Safety Mindset: In terms of safety, the FSM does take action to remove the candle, but it does not verify success or have a back-up scenario if the action fails. It's reasonably safe, but there is room for improvement. Score - 7.

5. Scalability: The simple structure of this FSM makes it quite easily scalable, as new states and transitions could be added. However, the lack of an action failure state would become increasingly limiting as the FSM becomes more complex. Score - 6.

6. Assistance UX: As for UX, it's rather linear, with only one series of actions (remove candle -> call for help) regardless of the context. The FSM could provide a better user experience by having more flexible action sequences. Therefore, I would give it a score of 5.

7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM uses action verbs from the vocabulary somewhat inconsistently. The transitions use some non-list verbs, such as "extinguish_and_remove_candle". However, many of the list verbs do appear, so I would rate it an 7.

Overall Benchmark Score for "3_3": (6 + 4 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 7) / 7 = 5.3

Analysis of FSM "3_4":
    
1. State Coverage: This FSM introduces an action for cleaning up spilled wax, making it more comprehensive in terms of state coverage. But, it also lacks a state to ensure the success of actions. I'd rate it 7.

2. Transition Coverage: The transitions in this FSM are quite comprehensive and well-structured, reflecting different situations that the robot could encounter. Score - 8.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM "3_4" has a higher level of complexity with more states and transitions. Yet, it remains relatively direct and manageable. Score - 5.

4. Safety Mindset: The FSM "3_4" involves a thorough outlook when it comes to safety. It removes the hazardous object and cleans up the risk of fire. However, it does not have a protocol for action failure. Score - 8.

5. Scalability: This FSM is more detailed hence making it less scalable. Addition of new states or transitions could complexly lead to intertwined action path. This can make it harder to observe, debug, or extend the FSM. Score - 5.

6. Assistance UX: User experience is moderately improved in this FSM, with the cleaning action providing a natural and efficient response to the scenario. Score - 7.

7. Action Set Alignment: FSM "3_4" makes a better attempt to adhere strictly to the defined action set vocabulary in encoding the assistance behaviors. It does introduce some custom tasks but mostly aligns with the list verbs. Score - 8.

Overall Benchmark Score for "3_4": (7 + 8 + 5 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 8) / 7 = 6.8

The "3_best" remains the optimal FSM for this scenario, with the other FSMs exhibiting certain trade-offs between complexity, coverage, safety, and action set alignment.
