To provide a comprehensive analysis, I will evaluate each FSM ("11_3" and "11_4") against the seven mentioned dimensions by comparison with the benchmark established by "11_best". 

**FSM "11_3"**

*1. State Coverage: 8*
This FSM covers most necessary states but lacks important ones like "MONITOR_PATIENT" and "ENSURE_COMFORT" present in the '11_best' example.

*2. Transition Coverage: 8*
It handles transitions between states quite well, but may miss some corner-case transitions such as transitioning back to 'ASSESS_SITUATION' if patient's condition worsens.

*3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7*
There is average complexity in state interconnectivity. However, compared to "11_best", this FSM has fewer transition paths and less complexity.

*4. Safety Mindset: 9*
The FSM takes into account the necessity to call for help if needed. However, there's no express intention to monitor the patient's comfort after delivering medicine which is part of the safety measures in the '11_best' model.

*5. Scalability: 8*
The FSM could be extended to other similar scenarios, but the absence of a state like "ENSURE_COMFORT" limits its scalability to situations where more comprehensive care is needed.

*6. Assistance UX: 7*
The user experience would be satisfactory but not exceptional given that the FSM does not include states that ensure the comfort of the patient, especially after delivering the medicine.

*7. Action Set Alignment: 10*
All actions align well with the defined action set with verbs like reaching, grasping, delivering and calling for help.

Overall Benchmark Score for "11_3": (8+8+7+9+8+7+10)/7 = ~ 8.14

**FSM "11_4"**

*1. State Coverage: 9*
This FSM is more comprehensive than "11_3" as it includes a state for 'MONITOR_PATIENT'. However, it still lacks 'ENSURE_COMFORT' state like in the '11_best' example.

*2. Transition Coverage: 9*
Similar to '11_best', it covers most state transitions, including reverting back to assessing situation if patient's condition worsens.

*3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 8*
It presents balanced state interconnectivity, with all states having one or two possible transitions.

*4. Safety Mindset: 10*
In addition to calling for help, this FSM monitors the patient indicating a proactive approach to safety, very much like '11_best'.

*5. Scalability: 9*
Having a state for monitoring patient indicates ability to extend to complex contexts.

*6. Assistance UX: 8*
The lack of a state focusing on patient comfort could hinder a complete user experience as in '11_best'.

*7. Action Set Alignment: 10*
The FSM makes use of actions like reaching, grasping, transporting, and calling for help that are part of the defined set.

Overall Benchmark Score for "11_4": (9+9+8+10+9+8+10)/7 = ~ 9.00

In conclusion, while both "11_3" and "11_4" have performed well in different dimensions against the benchmark "11_best", FSM "11_4" scores higher due to its more comprehensive set of states and transitions, indicating a better overall performance. Both, however, could benefit from including a state to ensure patient comfort after medicine delivery for a more rounded service.
