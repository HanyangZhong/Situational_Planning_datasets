First, I will analyze and score FSM "8_3".

1. State Coverage: The states in the "8_3" FSM seem to cover all the necessary elements provided in the scenario. It includes a state for assessing the situation, moving and arranging the knives, and also handling other elements such as the work in progress on the chopping board - a score of 8/10.

2. Transition Coverage: The transition between states seem to be complete and cover the likeliest sequences of actions. It successfully transitions from handling one knife to handling the next, and finally closing the drawer and handling other elements - a score of 10/10.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: In "8_3", each state seems to have one immediately following state. The states are not densely interconnected - a score of 3/10.

4. Safety Mindset: The FSM promises to act safely. States such as 'ROTATE_KNIFE' indicate an awareness of dangerous situations and the inclusion of 'ASSESS_SUPPORTING_ITEM' and 'CLEAN_AND_PLACE_CHOPPING_ITEM' shows the orientation towards safety - a score of 8/10.

5. Scalability: The FSM seems relatively easy to extend. The 'assess_situation_state' could potentially be enhanced to cover more safety hazards - a score of 7/10.

6. Assistance UX: FSM "8_3" does seem to provide a natural flow of interactions with the user. But it might not be very personalized - a score of 7/10.

7. Action Set Alignment: Most actions used by the FSM "8_3" can be found in the list of industry benchmark action verbs. However, there are some actions such as 'wiping' that are not contained in the action set - a score of 7/10.

The Overall Benchmark Score for the FSM "8_3" is the average of all scores: (8 + 10 + 3 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 7) / 7 = 7.14

Second, I will analyze and score FSM "8_4".

1. State Coverage: The states in the FSM "8_4" seem to cover all necessary elements for the given scenario. It includes states for assessing the situation, preparing and arranging the drawer, closing it, and then assessing for future hazards - a score of 10/10.

2. Transition Coverage: The states in FSM "8_4" are all interconnected and portray a full sequence of the possible actions - a score of 10/10.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM "8_4" also shows relatively low cyclomatic complexity. Each state predictably leads to the next with only a few having multiple possible subsequent states - a score of 2/10.

4. Safety Mindset: The FSM "8_4" focuses on safety by including states for assessing and reassessing the safety of the drawer - a score of 10/10.

5. Scalability: The FSM "8_4" seems easy to extend to other new contexts. The 'ASSESS_SITUATION' and 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT' states can potentially be enhanced to cover more safety hazards - a score of 9/10.

6. Assistance UX: FSM "8_4" seems to give a smooth and natural experience but personalization could be lacking - a score of 8/10.

7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM "8_4" seems to use actions primarily from the industry benchmark list, but some actions such as 'check' and 'proceeding' are not explicitly in the action set - a score of 8/10.

The Overall Benchmark Score for the FSM "8_4" is the average of all the individual score: (10 + 10 + 2 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 8) / 7 = 8.14

In conclusion, when compared to '8_best.txt', the FSMs in '8_3' and '8_4' perform relatively well but they could be slightly improved in terms of cyclomatic complexity and strictly aligning to the action set.
