Given the comprehensive details provided, to evaluate the FSMs in codes "10_3" and "10_4" rigorously, let's evaluate individual dimensions of "10_3" first for all dimensions in comparison to "10_best" as perfect 10's.

## "10_3" Evaluation:

1. **State Coverage:** The states of "10_3" are INITIAL, CHECK_PATH, MOVE_CHAIR, CHECK_CHAIR_POSITION, RETURN_TO_USER. They cover the scenario fairly well but the FSM does not account for assessing the owner's needs which may include more than just an obstructed path. We might rate this a 7/10.

2. **Transition Coverage:** This FSM transitions among all of its states correctly. However, it doesn't cover all potential sequences, such as calling for help when the chair is too heavy or if the task fails. For these reasons, we would rate this 8/10.

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** The complexity of 10_3 is less comparing to 10_best because the number of transitions and states are less, which may limit its effectiveness in some scenarios. 6/10.

4. **Safety Mindset:** 10_3 robot ensures safety by checking the path and the position of the chair. There's no explicit harm prevention method. The ensuring path method could lead to a safety issue if the robot miscalculates its intervention. Score: 7/10.

5. **Scalability:** The FSM in 10_3 is quite scalable. It would be relatively easy to add more states or increase complexity. However, requiring more specific states could result in excessive modification. Score: 7/10.

6. **Assistance UX:** The FSM doesn't appear to have any elements that would create a particularly pleasant interaction for the user. It completes its task but doesn't account for owner satisfaction or personalization of interactions. Score: 5/10.

7. **Action Set Alignment:** Most of the actions in "10_3" perfectly align with the action set vocabulary. Though there are others like "checking", "gripping" not mentioned in the action set leading to some points lost. Score: 8/10.

Average for 10_3: (7+8+6+7+7+5+8)/7 = 6.85 out of 10.

## "10_4" Evaluation:

1. **State Coverage:** Compared to 10_best, the FSM of the code 10_4 also has fewer states and does not cover all the necessary states to handle the entire scenario. So we can rate this 7/10.

2. **Transition Coverage:** The FSM transitions among all of its states effectively. It does not, however, cover all potential sequences. For example, in the event where moving the chair fails, there's no condition to handle this. Here we can rate this 7/10.

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** The complexity of "10_4" is less comparing to "10_best" due to the lower number of states and transitions. Rate 6/10.

4. **Safety Mindset:** In conditions like when the path is blocked, it moves the chair away effectively increasing safety. But there aren't explicit indicators to prevent harm. We see safety e.g., safely moving the chair. Score: 8/10.

5. **Scalability:** This FSM seems highly scalable and open to extension with additional states or conditions. Rate 8/10.

6. **Assistance UX:** The FSM lacks elements providing a personalized or contextual interaction for the user affecting the quality of user experience. This appears a bit more rigid although functional. Rate: 6/10.

7. **Action Set Alignment:** The coder of "10_4" sticks to the action set perfectly without introducing any extra custom actions. Hence we can rate this a 10/10 for this.

Average for 10_4: (7+7+6+8+8+6+10)/7 = 7.43 out of 10.

## Summary:

- "10_3" : Covers most of the necessary states and transitions but lacks in terms of user experience and addressing owner needs. It has a good action set alignment but more action could have been included.

- "10_4" : Also covers most of the necessary states and transitions but also lacks a personalized and contextual user experience. However, its action set alignment is perfect and includes a decent set of actions in the FSM.

These scores allow you to understand how their performance compares to the "10_best". These benchmarks can be used to tune and improve FSMs for future use in home assistance robots.
