To evaluate the FSMs, let's proceed in two steps. The first step involves evaluating each FSM according to the assessment dimensions you have specified. To do this, I will need to manually inspect both FSMs and make judgments based on the quality of their code and behaviors. Afterward in the second step, I can compare the two FSMs directly to the benchmark code "5_best" and provide a comparative analysis.

Step 1: Direct Evaluation of FSMs '5_3' and '5_4'

For '5_3':
- State Coverage: 8. The FSM covers most of the necessary states, but neglects certain states such as 'verifying safety' and 'calling for help' which the '5_best' FSM includes. 
- Transition Coverage: 7. While the FSM covers most likely sequences of actions, there are missing transitions, such as the situation in which the FSM finds more scattered medicine after securing the medicines and needs to transition back and collect them.
- Cyclomatic Complexity: 6. The FSM has a fair amount of interconnectivity but not as much as the '5_best' FSM.
- Safety Mindset: 7. The FSM includes safety measures by securing medications and cleaning, but lacks a call for help action in-case of emergencies.
- Scalability: 6. The FSM code could be extended to new contexts, but it would need quite a bit of modification.
- Assistance UX: 7. The assistance provided is relatively natural but lacks personalization. At times, interactions are rigid.
- Action Set Alignment: 8. Most of the actions are from the defined set but not all.

For '5_4':
- State Coverage: 8. Covers all the main states, misses only the verification of the safety state.
- Transition Coverage: 8. The FSM fully covers the transitions, except the scenario when it needs to reorganize the cabinet after calling for help.
- Cyclomatic Complexity: 6. Similar to FSM '5_3', the interconnectivity is not at the level of the '5_best' FSM.
- Safety Mindset: 8. Prioritizes safety, includes option to call for help. 
- Scalability: 7. This FSM is more modular in design, making it easier to extend to new contexts.
- Assistance UX: 7. Like '5_3', this FSM lacks personalized interactions.
- Action Set Alignment: 8. Again most of the actions are from the defined set but not all.

Step 2: Comparison with '5_best'
As per above analysis, FSM '5_4' seems to perform slightly better than '5_3' but both are not at '5_best' level, which has full coverage of states and transitions, places a high priority on safety, is scalable, provides a natural UX, and aligns closely with the defined action set.

Calculating the Overall Benchmark Scores:

For '5_3': The average score is (8+7+6+7+6+7+8)/7 = 7.0

For '5_4': The average score is (8+8+6+8+7+7+8)/7 = 7.43

The overall benchmark scores for FSM '5_3' and '5_4' are 7.0 and 7.43, respectively. These scores are compared to the score of 10 for '5_best'. Although these FSMs perform well, further improvements could potentially be made to increase performance to the level of '5_best'. These improvements could include adding missing states, improving the UX, and ensuring the FSMs strictly follow the defined action set.
