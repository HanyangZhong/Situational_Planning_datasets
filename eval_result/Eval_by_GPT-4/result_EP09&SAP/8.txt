Your requirements demand a thorough analysis of two Finite State Machines (FSMs) versus a benchmark, with specifically stated dimensions. Due to the complex nature of this task, I recommend using a dedicated code analysis tool or a carefully designed program. An AI like me can't evaluate the FSMs in actual code, as it requires runtime code analysis and understanding of context - tasks that are beyond my current capabilities. However, I can provide a high-level analysis and score based on the FSM framework provided.

For the `8_3` FSM, here's the relative analysis:

1. **State Coverage:** This FSM covers most of the necessary states - Initial, Secure Knives, Assess Situation, Check Environment, and Call for Help. However, it misses some actions like Organize Drawer, Close Drawer, or Final Check, present in the benchmark FSM. Hence, I would score it as `7/10`.

2. **Transition Coverage:** It does well in covering transition scenarios but lacks a transition to a state like `CALL_FOR_HELP` if it can't handle the situation in `SECURE_KNIVES`, etc. I would propose `6/10` for this dimension.

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** The FSM has a more straightforward structure with fewer interconnected states, so the cyclomatic complexity is relatively low. I will give `3/10`.

4. **Safety Mindset:** FSM secures the knives and checks the environment, so it's reasonably safe, but it lacks a safety check phase. Thus, suggest a score as `8/10`.

5. **Scalability:** The FSM appears to be easily extendable to accommodate new states and transitions. The score for this would be `8/10`.

6. **Assistance UX:** The interaction style appears fluid and user-oriented but does not account for nuances such as the manner of reorganizing the knives, closing the drawer, etc. Hence, score `7/10`.

7. **Action Set Alignment:** All actions used in the FSM seem to come from the action set, hence `10/10` for strict compliance.

The Overall Benchmark Score for `8_3` FSM is the average of the individual scores, which equals `(7 + 6 + 3 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 10)/7 = 7`.


For the `8_4` FSM, here's the relative analysis:

1. **State Coverage:** The FSM covers all the states necessary to handle the situation, making a score of `10/10`.

2. **Transition Coverage:** The transitions here cover all possible sequences and are correctly connected to handle different situations, which make `10/10`.

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** The state machine is quite complex with many interconnected states. This isn't inherently a problem but does add complexity, which would be `8/10`.

4. **Safety Mindset:** The FSM behaves safely by ensuring that the kitchen is hazard-free before and after organizing the knives. It scores `10/10`.

5. **Scalability:** It's easily extendable and adaptable to different contexts or new states and transitions due to its well-structured nature. Scores `10/10`.

6. **Assistance UX:** The FSM provides a natural, contextual interaction experience with precise states defined as per the user-action sequence. It earns `10/10`.

7. **Action Set Alignment:** All actions are aligned well within the set given, hence a score of `10/10`.

The Overall Benchmark Score for `8_4` FSM is the average of the individual scores, which equals `(10 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10)/7 â‰ˆ 9.7`.

This analysis offers a preliminary review based on the provided FSM structure and states definition. For a comprehensive analysis and definitive scores, a thorough practical implementation and testing environment are necessary.
