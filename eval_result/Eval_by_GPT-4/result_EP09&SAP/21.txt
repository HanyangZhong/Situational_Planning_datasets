Here's an analysis for the FSMs '21_3' and '21_4', using the scoring dimensions:

FSM "21_3" Dimension Scoring:

1. State Coverage: 7.5 - It covers most of the necessary states but misses out some states like 'assess_injuries'.
2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Transitions are logical and generally well-connected. 
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - The FSM is moderately interconnected, with a defined structure limiting denser connectivity.
4. Safety Mindset: 8 - Safety is a priority as there is calling for help if the person is unresponsive as well as monitoring the situation.
5. Scalability: 7 - The structure of the FSM makes it extendable, although the individual state actions may need adjusting for different scenarios.
6. Assistance UX: 8 - The checks on the person and alerting help contribute positively to the user experience.
7. Action Set Alignment: 7.5 - The FSM uses many of the actions from the list, but not all of the 56 verbs.

Overall Benchmark Score for "21_3": 7.43 (Average)

FSM "21_4" Dimension Scoring:

1. State Coverage: 8 - This FSM also covers a good range of states but also misses out some helpful states like 'assess_injuries'.
2. Transition Coverage: 8.5 - Transitions seem to cover all likely sequences. This FSM allows for a well-connected state transition.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - It has a moderate level of complexity.
4. Safety Mindset: 8.5 - The FSM includes a specific state for ensuring comfort, further highlighting its focus on safety.
5. Scalability: 8 - Current state transitions can be easily modified to include additional states as this FSM is structured.
6. Assistance UX: 8 - It checks on the person's condition, calls for help and also ensures person's comfort, providing a focused user experience.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - Reflects a large portion of the action set, aligning well with most of the 56 predefined verbs.

Overall Benchmark Score for "21_4": 7.86 (Average)

By comparing these scores with the "21_best" FSM, we can observe that the "21_4" FSM offers a more complete solution, with better scalability, safety mindset and user experience. However, it still lacks in cyclomatic complexity, which was perfectly covered by "21_best", showing an area where improvements could be made.
