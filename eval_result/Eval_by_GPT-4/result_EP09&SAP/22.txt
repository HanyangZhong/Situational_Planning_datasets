Sure, I can assist with that. Let's evaluate and score FSMs "22_3" and "22_4" across the seven dimensions you've specified, comparing each with "22_best".

First, the "22_3" FSM:

1. State Coverage: The "22_3" FSM adequately covers essential states, such as assessing the situation, activating alerts, assisting the woman, and calling for help. It's missing some nuances, like the woman's condition assessment and comforting the woman which are covered in the "22_best" FSM. As such, it scores an 8.

2. Transition Coverage: The transitions in the "22_3" FSM are well outlined but less detailed than "22_best". It lacks transitions like proceeding from notifying emergency to monitoring the situation. It scores a 7.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The "22_3" FSM is relatively simple with few interconnected states, making it score a 3 in cyclomatic complexity.

4. Safety Mindset: While "22_3" does prioritize safety by activating the alert system and assisting the woman, it doesn't fully assess her condition or provide comfort. Therefore, it scores a 6.

5. Scalability: This FSM shows possible extendibility to new contexts and can handle modifications. It scores an 7.

6. Assistance UX: The experience might feel rigid because there's no state dedicated to comforting or reassurance. So, it scores a 5.

7. Action Set Alignment: All the actions used in "22_3" FSM do align with the defined action set. Therefore, it scores a 10.

Overall Benchmark Score for "22_3": (8+7+3+6+7+5+10) / 7 = 6.57

Now for the "22_4" FSM:

1. State Coverage: "22_4" FSM has nearly complete coverage of necessary states, missing only the nuances like providing comfort or direct monitoring until help arrives. It scores a 9.

2. Transition Coverage: The FSM has well-connected transitions and covers likely sequences adequately, scoring an 8.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Like the "22_3", the "22_4" FSM also has a low cyclomatic complexity due to it's simple connections. It scores a 3.

4. Safety Mindset: The safety aspect in this FSM is well defined, with states dedicated to assist the woman, activate alerts, and call for help. It scores an 8.

5. Scalability: This FSM can be extended to new contexts and be modified so it scores an 8.

6. Assistance UX: The user experience gets an 7 because despite it efficiently assisting, activating alerts and calling for help, it's missing out on properly comforting or monitoring the woman until help arrives.

7. Action Set Alignment: The "22_4" FSM strictly uses actions from the defined action set, hence it scores a 10 in this category.

Overall Benchmark Score for "22_4": (9+8+3+8+8+7+10) / 7 = 7.57

In summary, "22_3" is effective but can be improved in terms of transition coverage and assistance UX, while "22_4" offers more comprehensive coverage and UX but is somewhat straightforward in its execution, resulting a lower cyclomatic complexity.
