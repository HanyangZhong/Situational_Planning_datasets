For code "20_3":

1. **State Coverage:** This FSM includes important states related to examining the situation, handling the device retrieval, assisting the elderly person, and calling for help. However, it does not include a state for interacting with the person, which can be crucial for responsive care. I would give this FSM a score of 7 in State Coverage.

2. **Transition Coverage:** Transition sequencing in this FSM includes tracking between situation analysis, reaching for the device, assisting the elderly, and calling for help. It also includes a transition to a state that continuously monitors the situation. This machine appears to cover significant expected sequences, so it gets an 8 for Transition Coverage.

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** The FSM in 20_3 has transitions between most states, but the nature of transitions is relatively simple, with a linear transition structure. Here, I would give a 4 score.

4. **Safety Mindset:** The FSM seems designed to quickly respond to the distress signals from the elderly person and activate the necessary helping service. However, it lacks clear methods for assessing the person or environment's safety. Thus, I give it a 6 for the Safety Mindset.

5. **Scalability:** The design of the FSM allows for easy addition or removal of states and transitions. Consequently, I yield a score of 8 for Scalability. 

6. **Assistance UX:** While the FSM is designed to respond to distress, there isn't any provision for a personalized or natural interaction. This yields a score of 4.

7. **Action Set Alignment:** The FSM appears to use actions like "reaching", "checking", and "calling for help", which are from the defined action set vocabulary. I will give a score of 7 here.

**Overall Benchmark Score for "20_3" :** The average of the seven scores (7, 8, 4, 6, 8, 4, 7) is approximately 6.3.

For code "20_4":

1. **State Coverage:** The FSM in code "20_4" encompasses nearly all the necessary states to handle the given scene, from situation assessment and approaching the elderly person to assisting and monitoring them. Therefore, it attains a 9 for State Coverage.

2. **Transition Coverage:** This FSM presents complete state transitions, moving smoothly from initial assessment to any necessary actions and help calls. It gets an 8 for Transition Coverage.

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** The transitions in this FSM demonstrate a moderate level of complexity, with most states branching out to two or more states. The score here would be a 6.

4. **Safety Mindset:** This FSM has a strong focus on safety, considering both immediate and ongoing concerns of the elderly individual. I award it an 8 for the Safety Mindset.

5. **Scalability:** It's clear this FSM was built with scalability in mind. Additional states and transitions can be easily integrated into the system. Therefore, I give it a 9.

6. **Assistance UX:** Assistance provided by this FSM appears to be more tailored towards the needs of an elderly person in distress and considers contextual elements. This yields a score of 7.

7. **Action Set Alignment:** The FSM does seem to limit its actions to ones like "approach", "reaching", "lowering", "activating", and "checking". It aligns well with the provided action set vocabulary, meriting a score of 9.

**Overall Benchmark Score for "20_4":** The average of the seven scores (9, 8, 6, 8, 9, 7, 9) is approximately 8.0.
