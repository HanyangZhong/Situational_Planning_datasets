Scoring for FSM in "14_3":

1. State Coverage: The state coverage is quite good and covers most of the required states such as initial, assess hazard, remove toxic food, distract cat, monitor cat, and call for help. There could be a small enhancement in adding a state for when the cat gets distracted. Score - 9.
   
2. Transition Coverage: The transition between states is quite accurate with each state leading logically to the corresponding next state based on inputs and events. There is no disconnected subgraph. Score - 10.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The interconnectivity between state is fairly straightforward with each state having 1-2 follow-on states. The complexity doesn't seem to be very high. Score - 5.
   
4. Safety Mindset: The FSM gives high priority to safety, either by removing hazards or distracting the cat. Emergency situations are addressed as well. Score - 10.
   
5. Scalability: The FSM is quite scalable as each state function can be expanded to include additional functionalities or actions. Score - 8.

6. Assistance UX: The code is clearly defined and does not seem much robotic. Actions are contextual. Score - 8.

7. Action Set Alignment: Almost all the actions used in the FSM are from the provided list (grasping, placing down, calling for help, monitoring). There are some additional custom actions (like detecting hazard) used. Score - 8.

Overall Benchmark Score for "14_3": (9 + 10 + 5 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 8) / 7 = 8.28

Scoring for FSM in "14_4":

1. State Coverage: The FSM provides a good coverage of states, though it's slightly less explicit about dealing with the cat (like attracting the cat's attention to a safe activity in the 14_best FSM). Score - 8.

2. Transition Coverage: Transition between states is well defined and there are no disconnected subgraphs. Score - 10.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The complexity seems to be moderate with each state followed by 1-2 states. Score - 6.

4. Safety Mindset: The FSM takes into account safety by removing toxic food and monitoring cat, but is less proactive than 14_best in keeping cat safe. Score - 8.

5. Scalability: The approach and structure used in the FSM makes it quite extendable to other contexts. Score - 7.

6. Assistance UX: The FSM is clearly defined and the behavior doesn't seem robotic. Actions are contextual. Score - 8.

7. Action Set Alignment: All the actions seem to be from the provided list (like grasping, placing down, calling for help, monitoring). Score - 10.

Overall Benchmark Score for "14_4": (8 + 10 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 8 + 10) / 7 = 8.14

In comparison to "14_best", both "14_3" and "14_4" have overall scores a bit lower. "14_3" and "14_4" FSMs could benefit from adding more states to deal proactively with the cat's behavior and safety. Their user experiences are comparable with that of "14_best" and their coverage of the action set is almost perfect. However, the complexity of their state transitions is lesser than that of "14_best". These areas are where enhancements could be made.
