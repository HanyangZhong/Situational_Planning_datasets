Sure, I will evaluate the FSMs in the "10_3" and "10_4" code sections based on the seven listed dimensions.

**1. FSM in "10_3" code section:**

State Coverage: 8/10. This FSM adequately covers the states necessary to guide the robot's behavior. There is room for improvement, however, for states that would handle exceptional cases.

Transition Coverage: 7/10. The FSM handles transitions well for the main functional pathways. However, it lacks transitions for unexpected or exceptional scenarios, such as the failure of the robot to perform its tasks.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 3/10. The FSM appears to be minimally complex, with each state leading to relatively few others. However, it might benefit from greater interconnectivity to accommodate more diverse scenarios.

Safety Mindset: 8/10. This FSM appears to put a great deal of emphasis on safety by ensuring the path is clear for the wheelchair user. However, it lacks specific states or transitions for dealing with unexpected safety concerns that might arise.

Scalability: 7/10. The FSM appears to be modular, which should facilitate the addition of new states and transitions. However, its minimal complexity could limit its scalability as more states or transitions are required to handle new scenarios.

Assistance UX: 7/10. The FSM is designed to help the wheelchair user reach the desk area. The user's needs have clearly been considered. However, it lacks states for providing feedback or communication with the user, which could detract from the user experience.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10. The FSM provides a solid alignment with the defined action set including the 'detect_obstacle', 'gripping', 'dragging', 'monitoring' and 'calling' verb functionalities. There may be space for more incorporation of these key verbs to further align with the standard.

Overall Benchmark Score for "10_3": (8 + 7 + 3 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 9)/7 = 7.0

**2. FSM in "10_4" code section:**

State Coverage: 9/10. This FSM comprehensively covers the required states to adequately guide the robot behavior. It caters to both the main functional pathways and edge cases.

Transition Coverage: 8/10. The FSM provides a good coverage of state transitions. However, handling of unexpected or exceptional scenarios could be improved.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10. The FSM appears to be quite minimally complex, with each state having few outputs. While this can be beneficial, in more complicated scenarios, a greater level of complexity and interconnectivity might be helpful.

Safety Mindset: 9/10. This FSM does a good job of emphasizing safety concerns by considering the different situations that may arise and demonstrating an ability to adapt to them.

Scalability: 8/10. The FSM is modular and well-positioned to be scaled up as it can accommodate additional states and transitions to handle new situations.

Assistance UX: 8/10. The FSM is designed to clear the path and assist the wheelchair user, keeping in mind their ease of path navigation. The FSM, however, could do more to provide direct feedback or communication with the user.

Action Set Alignment: 10/10. This FSM is very well aligned with the defined action set. It uses words from the list like 'grasping', 'dragging', 'reminding', and does not introduce any additional uncategorized actions.

Overall Benchmark Score for "10_4" : (9 + 8 + 4 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 10)/7 = 8.0

Keep in mind these scores are estimations based on code examination. Performance in a real environment could be different and would need iterative tests to refine the system.
