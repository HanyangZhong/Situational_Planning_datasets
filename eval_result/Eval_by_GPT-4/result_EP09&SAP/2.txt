Sure! I will evaluate "2_3" and "2_4" FSMs according to each dimension.

1. **State Coverage:**
    - "2_3": 6/10 - Covers important states, lacks explicit idle state, handling potential secondary conditions such as presence of pets.
    - "2_4": 8/10 - Good state coverage, explicitly includes a state to handle pets, missing CALL_FOR_HELP state like "2_best".

2. **Transition Coverage:**
    - "2_3": 6/10 - Transitions are logical but lack comprehensiveness for secondary conditions.
    - "2_4": 8/10 - Better transitions, could be improved by considering more conditional transitions.

3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:**
   - "2_3": 4/10 - A simple FSM missing some potential complications, potentially increasing complexity in handling additional conditions.
   - "2_4": 7/10 - More complex FSM handling more conditions, but can increase complexity with more states and transitions.

4. **Safety Mindset:**
   - "2_3": 6/10 - Robot tries to clean-up but doesn't consider other hazards like pets.
   - "2_4": 8/10 - Robot takes care of multiple hazards like spills and pets, enhancing safety.

5. **Scalability:**
   - "2_3": 5/10 - Simple FSMs which needs significant modification to scale for more conditions.
   - "2_4": 7/10 - More scalable FSM with handling of more conditions, needs further conditioning for full scalability.

6. **Assistance UX:**
   - "2_3": 7/10 - Good user experience in clean-up, lacks interaction with pets or humans.
   - "2_4": 8/10 - Better UX by managing more hazards, but lacks interaction with humans.

7. **Action Set Alignment:**
   - "2_3": 8/10 - Mostly uses actions within set, but falls short in action variety.
   - "2_4": 8/10 - Represents good usage of actions, could be better by accounting all possible actions.
   
**Overall Benchmark Score:**
   - "2_3": (6+6+4+6+5+7+8)/7 = 6
   - "2_4": (8+8+7+8+7+8+8)/7 = 7.7

These values provide a basic scoring of FSMs, further tuning and more exhaustive evaluation must be performed for real-world application. FSM "2_4" is superior compared to "2_3", but could still be improved to reach or exceed the performance of "2_best" FSM.
