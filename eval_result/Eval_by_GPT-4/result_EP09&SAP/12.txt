Code "12_3" Evaluation:

1. State Coverage: 7/10. This FSM includes essential states such as assessing the situation, clearing hazards, and monitoring movement. However, It lacks some of the detailed states seen in the "12_best" FSM, such as rearranging furniture, straightening the rug, and continuous monitoring of the environment.

2. Transition Coverage: 9/10. The FSM appears to cover most state transitions thoroughly, except the transition to re-assess the situation after initial clearing of hazards.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10. The FSM is not very complex, with primarily sequential steps. There's only one loop from 'MONITOR_MOVEMENT' to 'INITIAL'. 

4. Safety Mindset: 6/10. The FSM does include states for clearing hazards and monitoring the woman's movements. However, it doesnâ€™t include a safety provision for constantly monitoring hazards and invoking remedial actions.

5. Scalability: 7/10. The FSM shows scalability, safety assessment, and hazard clearance states can be extended to newer contexts.

6. Assistance UX: 7/10. By including state transitions that define the sequence of actions, this FSM provides a more natural, contextual experience.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10. The FSM seems to incorporate many appropriate actions like collecting, placing down, checking, and calling for help.

Overall Benchmark Score for "12_3": (7+9+4+6+7+7+8)/7 = 6.85


Code "12_4" Evaluation:

1. State Coverage: 8/10. This FSM covers fundamental states, such as identifying hazards, mitigating hazards, ensuring safety, and calling for help. It doesn't include more detailed states like rearranging furniture or straightening the rug, causing it to lose points.

2. Transition Coverage: 8/10. The FSM includes transitions between most states well, but lacks a state allowing for reiterative reassessment of the environment after initial hazard mitigation. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10. It has an average level of complexity. The complexity comes from the cycle between 'ENSURE_SAFETY' and 'IDENTIFY_HAZARDS' or 'CALL_FOR_HELP'. 

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10. The FSM has a fair approach to safety encompassing hazard identification, mitigation, and continuous monitoring for new hazards or emergencies. 

5. Scalability: 8/10. This FSM could be extended relatively easily to new contexts, as it has clear detection, mitigation, and safety monitoring states.

6. Assistance UX: 8/10. The FSM describes a logical flow from identifying to mitigating hazards and ensuring safety.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10. The FSM uses actions like detecting, reorganizing, collecting, placing down, monitoring, and calling for help from the predefined action set.

Overall Benchmark Score for "12_4": (8+8+5+7+8+8+8)/7 = 7.43

In summary, while both FSMs "12_3" and "12_4" provide a reasonable degree of coverage across dimensions, they do not match the superior quality and thoroughness of FSM "12_best" in certain aspects such as state coverage and safety mindset. However, "12_4" comes out slightly ahead of "12_3" due to better state coverage, monitoring, and assistance UX.
