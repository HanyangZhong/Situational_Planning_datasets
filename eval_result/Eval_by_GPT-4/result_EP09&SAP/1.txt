For the code "1_3":

State Coverage: 7/10. The states defined mostly cover the necessary tasks, but they miss closing the shower and defogging the mirror, compared to the "1_best" FSM.

Transition Coverage: 5/10. Transitions mostly cover the sequence, but they may not be optimal. Unlike the "1_best" FSM, transitions to addressing safety hazards or tidying the bathroom rely entirely on assessments in each cycle.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10. The FSM has less interconnectivity than "1_best", with most states transitioning only to "ASSESS_SITUATION".

Safety Mindset: 8/10. The FSM does address safety hazards, but it lacks a state to explicitly handle wet floor cleanup, like in the "1_best" FSM, which risks slip accidents.

Scalability: 7/10. The FSM is somewhat extendable for new tasks. The conditions for movements between states are broad, allowing more tasks to be added.

Assistance UX: 7/10. The user experience is quite straightforward, but it lacks the detail found in the "1_best" FSM which improves user interaction.

Action Set Alignment: 8/10. Most selected actions are within the approved vocabulary. However, there is room for improvement, such as including more specific actions for better alignment.

Overall Benchmark Score: 6.57/10. The "1_3" FSM covers many important tasks, aligns well with allowed actions and considers safety, but could improve in terms of transition coverage, performance optimization and user experience.

For the code "1_4":

State Coverage: 9/10. Almost all necessary states are covered, close to the "1_best" FSM.

Transition Coverage: 5/10. Transitions cover the sequence, but FSM performance relies heavily on frequently re-assessing situations in each cycle.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10. Although more efficient than "1_3", it does not interconnect states as well as "1_best" FSM, with most states transitioning back to "ASSESS_BATHROOM".

Safety Mindset: 8/10. The FSM addresses safety issues like wet floors and misplaced bath mats, yet it lacks explicit attention to shower closure like in "1_best".

Scalability: 8/10. This FSM allows for extensibility, as each step re-evaluates the situation before deciding what to do next.

Assistance UX: 8/10. The FSM provides a good user experience, methodically addressing every major concern in the bathroom setting.

Action Set Alignment: 9/10. The action vocabulary adheres well to the recommended list, with logical choices of actions for each state.

Overall Benchmark Score: 7.29/10. The "1_4" FSM performs well in most aspects, with potential improvement in reducing the loop of re-assessment and enhancing cyclomatic complexity alignment with "1_best".
