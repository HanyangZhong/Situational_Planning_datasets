Let's start analyzing each code based on the seven criteria you provided. 

1. Code "23_3":

State Coverage: 8/10. FSM includes a majority of needed states such as 'ASSESS_SITUATION', 'CALM_DOG', 'ENGAGE_CHILD', 'MONITOR_PLAY', and 'CALL_FOR_HELP'.

Transition Coverage: 7/10. FSM transitions display adequate coverage. Though, it might benefit from a state to manage if any unforeseen situations arise outside the norm.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10. The states are structured relatively simply, with each state leading to one or two successive states.

Safety Mindset: 9/10. The safety of the child seems to be a priority but could benefit from more obvious safety checks.

Scalability: 8/10. The structure of FSM is clean and extendable to different scenarios.

Assistance UX: 7/10. The robot assists effectively, but interaction could be improved with more targeted actions.

Action Set Alignment: 7/10. Most actions come from the vocabulary set. However, some actions could be more specific.

Overall Benchmark Score: (8+7+6+9+8+7+7)/7 = 7.4/10

2. Code "23_4":

State Coverage: 9/10. The FSM covers all the necessary states similar to "23_best" with an additional state of 'CALL_FOR_HELP'.

Transition Coverage: 8/10. The FSM covers the necessary transitions in a comprehensive and logical order.

Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10. There are more transitions than in "23_3", contributing to greater complexity.

Safety Mindset: 8/10. High focus on safety, but lacks specific actions.

Scalability: 7/10. The code is organized in a manner that is easy to extend and modify, but includes more states and transitions, making it more complex to scale.

Assistance UX: 7/10. The interaction is not overly specific. There is room for more nuanced engagement.

Action Set Alignment: 6/10. Uses some commercial action vocabulary, but several critical actions may not belong to the list.

Overall Benchmark Score: (9+8+7+8+7+7+6)/7 = 7.4/10

The scores are relatively close for the two codes when compared to the benchmark "23_best". The scores reflect a good handling of the scenario with a prime attention towards safety but could be improved in terms of complexity, user experience and following the action set vocabulary.
