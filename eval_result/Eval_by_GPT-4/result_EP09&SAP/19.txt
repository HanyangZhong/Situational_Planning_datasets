First, note that this analysis is conceptual because actual scoring requires running the FSMs against a real home assistance robot. Nevertheless, here are qualitative ratings for each requested dimension:

**FSM: "19_3"** 

1. State Coverage: 8. This FSM has 6 states which cover the scenario decently. Still it lacks the explicit state to monitor stove, which is included in "19_best". 
2. Transition Coverage: 7. The transitions cover most of the sequences, but it lacks granularity in assessing different outcomes of the prevent_danger_state.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6. The FSM is simple with small interconnectivity, which makes it fall short on the complexity scale.
4. Safety Mindset: 9. This FSM shows a clear emphasis on safety by including 'PREVENT_DANGER', 'ENSURE_SAFETY', 'CALL_FOR_HELP' states.
5. Scalability: 8. The structure and methods of this FSM make it fairly easy to extend for other tasks.
6. Assistance UX: 7. The code is clearly organized and readable, but some actions might not feel natural (for instance, instantly changing from 'prevent_danger_state' to 'engage_child_state').
7. Action Set Alignment: 8. Actions are selected from 'ACTION_SET', although some actions are general, like remider.
Overall Benchmark Score: 7.6

**FSM: "19_4"** 

1. State Coverage: 7. This FSM has 6 states which lack an explicit state to secure the stove and to assess the outcome of child distraction.
2. Transition Coverage: 6. The FSM transitions cover some of the sequences, but they lack the 'ASSESS_DISTRACTION_OUTCOME' transition from the '19_best'.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5. The FSM is simple with minimal interconnectivity.
4. Safety Mindset: 8. Explicit states related to 'PREVENT_DANGER' and 'CALL_FOR_HELP' show its safety inclination.
5. Scalability: 9. Given its simplicity and organisation, this FSM seems scalable.
6. Assistance UX: 7. User experience might be impacted by the sudden transition from 'prevent_danger' to 'engage_child'.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8. Actions are selected within 'ACTION_SET' list. Yet, some actions like 'delivering' sound more specific and might be off from given action set.
Overall Benchmark Score: 7.1

These ratings indicate "19_3" FSM outperforms "19_4" FSM across dimensions. Compared to "19_best", both fall short in their handling of stove safety and child distraction. Notably, "19_best" has a more complex web of state transitions aiding in comprehensive situation handling, which is missing in both "19_3" and "19_4".
