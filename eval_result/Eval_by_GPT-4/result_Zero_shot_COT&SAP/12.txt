Analysis of the FSM in Code "12_3":

1. State Coverage: This FSM covers the necessary states like 'ASSESS_SITUATION', 'CLEAR_HAZARDS', and 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT'. However, it does not include states for 'ENSURING_SAFETY' and 'CALL_FOR_HELP' explicitly which are in the benchmark FSM. Therefore, giving it a Score of 7/10.
2. Transition Coverage: All the states seem to be connected logically and completely, it moves from assessing situation to clear hazards and then to monitor environment and handles emergencies. However, loopback to 'ASSESS_SITUATION' from 'MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT' could be problematic in some scenarios. Score: 8/10.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: This FSM has sufficient complexity to handle the tasks at hand. It also includes transitions from every state leading to a connected state graph. Score: 7/10.
4. Safety Mindset: Safety measures are evident in the 'CLEAR_HAZARDS' state and emergency handling, but preventive safety measures could be more explicit. Score: 7/10.
5. Scalability: This FSM demonstrates good design that could be extended to other contexts, tasks, or hazard types. Score: 8/10.
6. Assistance UX: The user experience seems smooth from assessing hazards to clearing them and monitoring. Better personalization may be needed. Score: 7/10.
7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM seems to be following the listed actions like 'detecting', 'rearranging', 'collecting' and 'placing down'. Yet, some actions may not align strictly with the provided 56-verb list. Score: 7/10.

Overall Benchmark Score for "12_3": (7+8+7+7+8+7+7)/7 = ~7.29

Analysis of the FSM in Code "12_4":

1. State Coverage: This FSM covers the necessary states like 'IDENTIFY_HAZARDS', 'MITIGATE_HAZARDS', and 'ENSURE_SAFETY'. It is, therefore, comprehensive and similar to the benchmark. Score: 9/10.
2. Transition Coverage: The transitions among the states are well covered and logical. It has a similar structure to the benchmark, with each state leading to the next appropriately. Score: 9/10.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The complexity in this FSM seems appropriate, with each state having clear and defined transitions. Score: 8/10.
4. Safety Mindset: This FSM has strong emphasis on safety, with hazard identification, mitigation, ensuring safety, and emergency call. Score: 10/10.
5. Scalability: The FSM offers high extendibility to new contexts, tasks, or hazard types with its state and transition design. Score: 9/10.
6. Assistance UX: FSM leads to a smooth and logical flow from one state to another providing a comfortable user experience. Score: 9/10.
7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM strictly uses actions from the provided action set, like 'detecting', 'reorganize', 'monitoring', and 'calling'. Score: 9/10.

Overall Benchmark Score for "12_4": (9+9+8+10+9+9+9)/7 = ~9.00
