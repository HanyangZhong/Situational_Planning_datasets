Let's analyze the FSMs in code "20_3" and "20_4" against the seven dimensions.  

FSM "20_3":
1. State Coverage: The FSM covers most necessary states to handle the scene. Some states from the benchmark, like waiting for help response, assisting human helpers, and using emergency device, are missed out. Score: 7.
2. Transition Coverage: The FSM covers almost all likely sequences. However, it may not cover the scenario where help is delayed. Score: 8.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Comprehensible level of complexity. Transitions from one state to other are well defined but could be more interconnected. Score: 6.
4. Safety Mindset: The FSM has the elderly's wellbeing in mind and calls for help when needed. But the delay in help isn't considered. Score: 8.
5. Scalability: The FSM structure can be easily extendable to accommodate new contexts like delay in help. Score: 8.
6. Assistance UX: FSM responds as per the distress signs of elderly person, making the interaction natural and personalized. Score: 9.
7. Action Set Alignment: This FSM primarily uses actions from the set vocabulary. A few actions such as 'lowering' are introduced but overall alignment to benchmark action vocabulary is observed. Score: 8.

FSM "20_3" Overall Benchmark Score: (7+8+6+8+8+9+8)/7 = 7.7 

FSM "20_4":
1. State Coverage: The FSM covers the necessary states similar to the benchmark FSM. Yet, states like waiting for help response and assisting human helpers are missing. Score: 7.
2. Transition Coverage: State transitions in this FSM cover likely sequences but may not cover situations where help is delayed. Score: 8.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Medium complexity with well-defined transitions but more interconnectivity could be beneficial. Score: 6.
4. Safety Mindset: Elderly's safety is prioritized and help is called when needed. However, scenario of help delay is not covered. Score: 8.
5. Scalability: FSM can be reliably extended to cover new contexts. Score: 9.
6. Assistance UX: FSM facilitates high quality user experience by monitoring elderly person's status routinely and using emergency device. Score: 9.
7. Action Set Alignment: Most of the verb actions are from set vocabulary, although few actions such as 'approaching', 'activating' are outside the benchmark. Score: 7.

FSM "20_4" Overall Benchmark Score: (7+8+6+8+9+9+7)/7 = 7.7 

By comparing these scores with the "20_best" FSM, you will notice that while they perform reasonably well in most dimensions, they could enhance areas of safety mindset, state and transition coverage, and cyclomatic complexity to better match up to the "20_best" FSM. The overall benchmark scores suggest that these FSMs perform around 77% as well as the "20_best" FSM. These scores can be used to identify areas of improvement and fine-tune these FSMs to better handle home assistance scenarios.
