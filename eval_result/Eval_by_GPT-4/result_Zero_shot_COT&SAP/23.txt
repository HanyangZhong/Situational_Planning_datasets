Let's evaluate and score "23_3" and "23_4" based on the provided dimensions:

## 23_3 FSM Analysis:

**1. State Coverage: 8/10**
   "23_3" FSM includes multiple important states related to both calming the dog and engaging the child in safe activities. However, it lacks a specific safety assurance state, present in "23_best".

**2. Transition Coverage: 7/10**
   The FSM covers most transitions effectively. Yet, its looped transitions could make it inefficient in the event of rapidly changing circumstances, as compared to "23_best" that has more direct transitions.

**3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10**
   The FSM is too linear and lacks interconnectedness, reducing the FSM flexibility in handling rapidly changing situations.

**4. Safety Mindset: 7/10**
   The FSM prioritizes safety by addressing the rough play, however, it could use more proactive measures such as in the 'ensure_safety' state in the "23_best" FSM to maximize safety.

**5. Scalability: 8/10**
   The FSM is designed with abstraction that allows easier addition of states or transitions.

**6. Assistance UX: 7/10**
   While the FSM is designed to mitigate the risk, it lacks personalization that is present in the "23_best" FSM.

**7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10**
   Almost all actions align with the defined vocabulary. A few additional actions are used for clearer explanation.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 7.4/10**

## 23_4 FSM Analysis:

**1. State Coverage: 9/10**
   "23_4" FSM includes important states related to calming the dog, engaging the child, and monitoring the situation. Direct safety enforcement state is missing.

**2. Transition Coverage: 8/10**
   This FSM has more comprehensive transitions including loops and direct transitions. However, the resetting to 'initial' state can cause repetition.

**3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10**
   This FSM has a bit more interconnectedness than "23_3", allowing a bit more flexibility in response.

**4. Safety Mindset: 9/10**
   The FSM has a strong safety but lacks a targeted state for safety enforcement as in "23_best".

**5. Scalability: 9/10**
   Code is neatly organized and states are well modularized, making it easier to modify or expand the FSM.

**6. Assistance UX: 8/10**
   It handles the situation well but lacks personalized actions seen in "23_best".

**7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10**
   The FSM strictly adheres to the action set vocabulary with few minor exceptions.

**Overall Benchmark Score: 8.3/10**

Both state machines have their strengths and weaknesses. However, the "23_best" FSM provided is more robust in terms of safety mindset and user experience. With some modifications, both the "23_3" and "23_4" FSMs could be improved to more closely align with the "23_best" FSM.
