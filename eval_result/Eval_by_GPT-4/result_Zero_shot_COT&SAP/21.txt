Sure, let's start by evaluating the FSM embedded in the code "21_3". Here are the scores for each dimension:

1. State Coverage: 8. This FSM covers a broad range of states from assessing the situation to waiting for help. However, compared to the benchmark "21_best", it lacks specific states like assessing injuries and providing needed help based on the assessment.
   
2. Transition Coverage: 9. Transitions are well laid out, ensuring that necessary actions are taken in sequence. However, there's room for a more complex consideration of transitions incorporating the person's condition into the process.
   
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 8. The FSM has a good level of complexity achieving a balance between interconnectedness and comprehensibility. However, "21_best" has a slightly denser network of states and transitions.
   
4. Safety Mindset: 9. The assistant demonstrates a safety-first approach by moving to assist and call for help immediately when a fallen person is detected, but it could further consider potential injuries.
   
5. Scalability: 10. The FSM's modular structure, with straightforward state definitions and transition rules, makes it easily expandable to handle additional scenarios and responsibilities.
   
6. Assistance UX: 7. The FSM from the code "21_3" demonstrates an understanding of the scenario, but without the context of potential injuries, its responsiveness to user needs might not be as complete as in the "21_best" FSM.
   
7. Action Set Alignment: 10. All the actions are drawn from the defined action set coding in a way that aligns well with the scenario. 

The Overall Benchmark Score for "21_3": (8+9+8+9+10+7+10) / 7 = 8.7


Now, let's evaluate the FSM embedded in the code "21_4". Here are the scores for each dimension:

1. State Coverage: 9. This FSM covers comprehensive stages from assessment to ensuring comfort, which most other states in "21_best" are present, although it does not explicitly state a 'check injury' state.

2. Transition Coverage: 9. The state transitions are well defined with good coverage of likely sequences, but there could be more explicit transitions based on person's health conditions.
   
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 8. There's a reasonable complexity in the FSM with a well-defined sequence of states, but there could be more interconnectivity between states based on different conditions.
   
4. Safety Mindset: 9. The assistant quickly and correctly assesses the situation, calls for help, and provides immediate assistance, ensuring the safety of the person.
   
5. Scalability: 10. The FSM is well-structured for scalability. The code is modular and could easily be extended to handle new scenarios.
   
6. Assistance UX: 8. The FSM takes a thoughtful approach to the scenario providing responsive and potentially personalized assistance, but there could be more explicit attention to the user's subjective experience.
   
7. Action Set Alignment: 10. The FSM codes actions within the benchmarked vocabulary well, fully capturing the required actions.

The Overall Benchmark Score for "21_4": (9+9+8+9+10+8+10) / 7 = 9


In summary, the FSM in the code "21_3" covers most essential states and transitions with a slightly lower focus on the user's experience compared to "21_best". The FSM "21_4" is closer to the "21_best" FSM, covering states thoroughly and providing a more personalized user experience.
