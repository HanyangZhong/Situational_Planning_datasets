Alright, I'll go ahead and evaluate each of the Finite State Machines(FSMs) based on the specified dimensions:

FSM `1_3`:

1. State Coverage: 7 - The FSM covers most of the necessary states (e.g., assessing the situation, drying the floor, fixing the bath mat, hanging the towel, wiping the surfaces) but it doesn't include some states from `1_best` like 'CHECK_SHOWER', 'FINAL_CHECK', and 'ROUTINE_CHECK'.
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - Transitions are generally well covered between states, but not thoroughly interconnected as needed, for example, it lacks a re-assessment step after each action.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4 - This FSM has a linear sequence of states with fewer interconnections, which makes it less complex compared to `1_best`.
4. Safety Mindset: 6 - While the FSM shows concern for safety through drying the floor and arranging the mat, it lacks consideration of checking shower closure which might be an issue for safety.
5. Scalability: 5 - FSM is somewhat extendable but lacks the intricacy and completeness of '1_best'. It is lacking in 'check shower', 'final check', and 'routine check' states.
6. Assistance UX: 6 - The user experience might be natural but lacks personalized interaction or context, whereas `1_best` provides more contextually aware behaviour.
7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - All actions are directly taken from the given list of 56 verbs, they are within the defined action-set.

Overall Benchmark Score for `1_3`: (7 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 9) / 7 = 6.14

FSM `1_4`:

1. State Coverage: 8 - The FSM includes most necessary states including assessing bathroom, cleaning floor, adjusting bath mat, hanging towel, and clearing steam, but it doesn't include 'FINAL_CHECK' or 'ROUTINE_CHECK'.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - This FSM does a fair job ensuring the states are connected logically but after each state it assesses the condition again, which is not very efficient.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - The FSM is similarly sequenced but with back-transitions to 'assess' after each action, but it doesnâ€™t have a routine check which makes it less interconnected.
4. Safety Mindset: 7 - Cleans wet floor, arranges bath mat correctly indicating safety concerns. But, like FSM `1_3`, it lacks a shower closure check.
5. Scalability: 6 - Can cover additional contexts reasonably but will require updates for thorough coverage.
6. Assistance UX: 7 - It handles sequence of actions well but lacks the depth of interaction to fully meet user needs.
7. Action Set Alignment: 9 - This FSM also stays consistent with the defined action-set. 

Overall Benchmark Score for `1_4`: (8 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 9) / 7 = 7

These assessments show that while FSMs `1_3` and `1_4` have some merits, they both fall short of '1_best' in different ways. Each could benefit from enhanced state coverage, better transition completeness, and a commitment to safety as indicated by the presence of all necessary checks.
