Before proceeding with scoring, we need to review the FSMs in the actual Python code for "2_3" and "2_4".

Given that the FSM in "2_best" has been rated perfect 10s across all the seven dimensions, let's analyze FSM "2_3". 

**FSM "2_3" Analysis:**
1. **State Coverage:** This FSM covers Assessment, Securing, Cleaning, Restoration and Final Check. However, it lacks states for Monitoring and Calling for Help, which are essential for enhancing safety and dynamic adaptability. It also lacks a unique state for handling unexpected situations. Score: 7.
2. **Transition Coverage:** This FSM has decent transitions covering most typical sequences, but it lacks a loopback from the Final Check to other states, thus potentially missing a recurrence during cleanup. Score: 6.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** This FSM has a linear structure with low cyclomatic complexity. There is no state from which it can transition to multiple other states. Score: 2.
4. **Safety Mindset:** The FSM does a good job in ensuring safety, like removing pets from the area and placing a warning sign. However, it doesn't include proactive steps for avoiding spills from the stove or a mechanism to call for help. Score: 6.
5. **Scalability:** The FSM is organized in a simplified and rational manner, which allows relatively easy extension and adaptation to other scenarios. Score: 7.
6. **Assistance UX:** The FSM does not provide any explicit interaction with the user, lacking personalization or contextualization of actions. Score: 5.
7. **Action Set Alignment:** It aligns well with the provided action set, with every action it takes, like mopping, checking, being part of the given list. Score: 10.

By averaging these scores, the Overall Benchmark Score for "2_3" is approximately 6.14.

**FSM "2_4" Analysis:**
1. **State Coverage:** FSM "2_4" is similar to "2_3", but it adds an IDLE state, which is a useful addition. However, it still lacks states for Monitoring, Calling for Help and handling unexpected situations, limiting its complete functionality. Score: 7.5.
2. **Transition Coverage:** This FSM also has a lack of loops back from the Final Check, possibly missing any recurring spill. Score: 6.5.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** The complexity of the FSM is also low, with a relatively linear structure. However, there is a bit more flexibility in transitions, with possibilities for returning, for example, to the Assess Situation state. Score: 3.
4. **Safety Mindset:** Similar to "2_3", it adequately ensures safety but lacks steps for preventing spills from the stove and does not have a mechanism to call for help. Score: 6.5.
5. **Scalability:** The FSM is organized in a slightly more complex but still effective manner, allowing for quite easy extension and adaptation to other scenarios. Score: 8.
6. **Assistance UX:** Like "2_3", it does not provide any explicit interaction with the user, lacking personalization or contextualization of actions. Score: 5.
7. **Action Set Alignment:** All its actions align well with the provided action sets. Score: 10.

By averaging these scores, the Overall Benchmark Score for "2_4" is approximately 6.71.

**Summary**
Both FSM "2_3" and "2_4" have relatively decent functionality and adherence to the action set. However, they lack states for ongoing monitoring, a call for help and handling exceptional situations. These deficiencies limit their operational scope, effectively lowering their score when compared to "2_best".
