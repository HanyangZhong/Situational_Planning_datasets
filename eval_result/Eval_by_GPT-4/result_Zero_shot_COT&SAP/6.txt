Code "6_3" Analysis:

The FSM in "6_3" has a full set of necessary states to handle the scenario. It begins with an initial state, assesses the situation, secures hazardous items, cleans any spills, returns items to their place, performs a final check, and enters an idle state waiting for further instructions or periodically monitoring the room.

1. State Coverage: 9/10 - All necessary states are covered, but the state for checking open doors or windows is missing. 
2. Transition Coverage: 9/10 - Every state is properly connected to subsequent states, but there's no state for exception cases like a persistent spill or unavailable safe storage for dangerous items.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 8/10 - The FSM is less complex, as each state is primarily connected to one subsequent state. However, improvement can be made for handling different scenarios.
4. Safety Mindset: 9/10 - Â The machine identifies and secures hazards, cleans spills, and performs a final safety inspection. However, it doesn't consider hidden risks like open doors/windows, hence the reduced score.
5. Scalability: 8/10 - The FSM is extendible to new contexts but requires additional states and transitions to handle different possible scenarios.
6. Assistance UX: 9/10 - The FSM moves logically from stream to stream but doesn't seem personalized and reactive to user-specific preferences or circumstances.
7. Action Set Alignment: 10/10 - The FSM uses recognized actions of a butler bot like 'capping', 'standing_up', 'wiping', 'placing_down', 'checking', and 'monitoring'. 

Overall Benchmark Score for "6_3": (9+9+8+9+8+9+10) / 7 = 8.9

Code "6_4" Analysis:

The FSM in "6_4" is similar to "6_3", but it includes a 'call_for_help_state' in case the situation is unmanageable. It assesses the situation, secure chemicals, cleans spills, checks for additional dangers and reverts to initial state if no danger is found. 

1. State Coverage: 10/10 - The FSM covers all required states including an extra state for calling for help when the situation is out of control. 
2. Transition Coverage: 10/10 - State transitions cover likely sequences including an edge case where the FSM cannot secure the situation and needs to call for help.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 8/10 - Similar to "6_3", the FSM is not very complex with each state connected to the next, but lacks handling for diverse scenarios.
4. Safety Mindset: 10/10 - The FSM not only identifies and secures hazards but also considers hidden risks like open doors or windows and has an option to call for help.
5. Scalability: 8/10 - The FSM is designed to extend to new contexts, but might need more states and transitions for handling varying situations.
6. Assistance UX: 9/10 - The FSM depicts a logical sequence of actions but lacks user-specific customization.
7. Action Set Alignment: 10/10 - The FSM strictly adheres to actions within the set list, like 'closing', 'placing_down', 'wiping', 'sweeping', 'checking' and 'calling_for_help'.

Overall Benchmark Score for "6_4": (10+10+8+10+8+9+10) / 7 = 9.3

Though both "6_3" and "6_4" follow the actions set vocabulary and major states sequence, "6_4" has an edge in terms of safety with an additional state for calling for help in emergency scenarios.
