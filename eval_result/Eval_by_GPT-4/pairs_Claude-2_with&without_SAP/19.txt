Okay, let's analyze "19_3" and "19_4" against the "19_best" code for their FSM across the seven dimensions.

**FSM "19_3" analysis:**

1. State Coverage: "19_3" covers the necessary states to handle the scene, but it fails to include a state to monitor the entire environment, which is crucial in the scenario. Score 7.

2. Transition Coverage: All major state transitions are covered, but it misses continuous checks to reevaluate the situation. Score 7.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: FSM "19_3" has a fair level of state interconnectivity, but it could be optimized to achieve a lower level of complexity. Score 6. 

4. Safety Mindset: The FSM exhibits reasonable safety behavior but lacks a proactive measure to reduce risk by turning off the stove when first detecting child's proximity. Score 8.

5. Scalability: The current FSM can be difficult to scale due to lack of compartmentalization each state's action, making it harder to modify. Score 5.

6. Assistance UX: Experience might be quite rigid as it lacks the dimension of continuous environment monitoring and suggestive child distracting diversions. Score 6.

7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM uses some descriptive actions from the list. However, it could become more robust if it called procedures that are embedded with the list's verbs. Score 7. 

Overall Benchmark Score for "19_3": (7+7+6+8+5+6+7)/7 = 6.57.

**FSM "19_4" analysis:**

1. State Coverage: "19_4" has better state coverage, including a state for constantly monitoring the scene. However, it lacks a state for assessing the outcome of its actions. Score: 8.

2. Transition Coverage: The transitions are fairly well covered, looping back to reevaluate after actions. Score: 9.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The complexity is moderate with some room for improvement. Score: 7. 

4. Safety Mindset: The FSM considers the safety by turning off the stove and continually monitoring the scene. Score: 9.

5. Scalability: Code is cleaner and more modular than "19_3", making it easier to extend or modify. Score: 9.

6. Assistance UX: The experience should be better as the FSM is continuously monitoring the scene and responding accordingly. Score: 9.

7. Action Set Alignment: Actions in the FSM are not perfectly mapping to the list's verbs. More appropriate use of actions would make the FSM more robust. Score: 7. 

Overall Benchmark Score for "19_4": (8+9+7+9+9+9+7)/7 = 8.43.

In this analysis, FSM "19_4" outperforms "19_3" across all dimensions and holds up reasonably well against the "19_best" code. These ratings provide an avenue to improve both FSMs against the set dimensions and the industry benchmark "19_best". The YuMi's FSM "19_4" particularly stands out for its responsiveness and user-friendly approach. However, both FSMs could perform even better with more explicit use of the action set vocabulary.
