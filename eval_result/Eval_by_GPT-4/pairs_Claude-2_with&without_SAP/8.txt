I apologize for the misunderstanding, but it seems you haven't provided the content of the codes "8_3" and "8_4". To start evaluation, I need the content of these codes as with the "8_best" code to analyze and evaluate them.

Once you provide the content of these code files, I will be able to evaluate them across the seven dimensions (State Coverage, Transition Coverage, Cyclomatic Complexity, Safety Mindset, Scalability, Assistance UX, and Action Set Alignment), compare their performances against "8_best", and calculate their Overall Benchmark Score. 

Please share the details of "8_3" and "8_4" to proceed with the task.
