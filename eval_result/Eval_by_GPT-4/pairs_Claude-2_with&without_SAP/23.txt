Analysis and Score for FSM "23_3":

1. State Coverage: 6/10 - This FSM covers 'Observing', 'Warning', 'Intervening', and 'Concluding' as states, and some important states from the "23_best" model such as assessing interaction and ensuring safety are missing. 

2. Transition Coverage: 5/10 - Transitions among states are not comprehensive, with limited to only unsafe observations leading to intervention and then conclusion. 

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10 - '23_3' has simple transitions with fewer connections, leading to less density and complexity.

4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - The FSM does consider safety by identifying rough play situations and intervenes as well.

5. Scalability: 7/10 - The '23_3' FSM has open-ended state functions such as 'is_play_too_rough' which can be extended to handle more complex situations. 

6. Assistance UX: 7/10 - The user experience is decent, with the robot actively intervening and warning in case of unsafe play. However, the child engagement and play monitoring are missing.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - This FSM uses a set of actions such as 'move', 'speak', 'grab', and 'lead', which is aligned with the 56 verb action set vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score: (6+5+6+7+7+7+8)/7 = 6.6/10

Analysis and Score for FSM "23_4":

1. State Coverage: 5/10 - Even though the FSM comprises 'Initial', 'Observation', 'Dog Redirection', and 'Child Comfort' states, important states like 'Safety Assurance' or 'Play Monitoring' are not covered.

2. Transition Coverage: 6/10 - The FSM has limited transitions with no back loop to 'Initial' state from others like 'Observation' makes transitions incomplete.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7/10 - The FSM has intermediate complexity with 'Initial' having one following state, 'Observation' having two following states,  and 'Dog Redirection', 'Child Comfort' having one following state each.

4. Safety Mindset: 8/10 - This FSM executes tasks with a good safety mindset, but lacking auto safety checking before moving to 'Observation' state.

5. Scalability: 6/10 - FSM is scalable to some extent with 'Observation' state, but lack of dynamic handling like 'calling for help' limits scalability.

6. Assistance UX: 7/10 - The user experience is good with the robot redirecting the dog and comforting the child. But, the cycle repetition engine is not implemented here to check back if the child is safe or not.

7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - The FSM responses are aligned using actions 'reaching', 'grasping', 'lifting', 'observing', 'grasping', 'transporting', 'releasing' from the mentioned base set of action words.

Overall Benchmark Score: (5+6+7+8+6+7+8)/7 = 6.7/10
