Evaluation of FSM 12_3:

1. State Coverage: The FSM does a good job of covering the relevant states required to navigate the scene. However, it lacks states for the adjustment of the rug, the movement of furniture or assisting the occupant in case of an emergency. This results in major gaps in coverage. Score: 5/10
2. Transition Coverage: The FSM provides a straightforward sequence of states that follow logically. However, it lacks complexity, potentially missing less predictable scenarios. Score: 6/10
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: FSM 12_3 is minimally complex and lacks flexibility in its transitions. Only linear transitions are present. Score: 1/10
4. Safety Mindset: While the FSM does attempt to clear hazards, it lacks a step for checking the safety of the occupant＊s environment post-cleanup or making necessary adjustments to furniture and rugs. Score: 6/10
5. Scalability: Even though it does not cover all possible states for this specific scenario, the FSM is modular enough to extend with additional states if required. Score: 7/10
6. Assistance UX: The FSM includes a ＆guide＊ state which emphasizes user interaction. However, it does not provide explicit text for other actions such as clearing path, which could enhance the experience. Score: 7/10
7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM uses the actions 'pick_up' and 'walk_with' which are not in the defined action set. Score: 6/10
Overall Benchmark Score: (5+6+1+6+7+7+6)/7 = 5.4

Evaluation of FSM 12_4:

1. State Coverage: FSM 12_4 has a similar state coverage to FSM 12_3, missing states for furnishing adjustments and emergency assistance. Score: 5/10
2. Transition Coverage: Similar to FSM 12_3, FSM 12_4 provides a simple sequence of states lacking in complexity. Score: 6/10
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: FSM 12_4, like FSM 12_3, is also minimally complex. Score: 1/10
4. Safety Mindset: FSM 12_4 again clears the path of obstacles but lacks steps to monitor the environment and occupant post-cleanup or to make necessary adjustments to the environment. Score: 6/10
5. Scalability: While there are gaps within the current state coverage, these could be filled with additional states due to the modularity of the FSM. Score: 7/10
6. Assistance UX: The FSM directly assists the pregnant woman, which is good for user experience. However, user experience could be further enhanced by providing more detailed interaction with the user during each state. Score: 7/10
7. Action Set Alignment: FSM 12_4 uses 'checking', 'grasping', and 'transporting' while 'guiding', which are all in the defined action set. However, 'unfolding' isn't explicitly included in the action set. Score: 8/10
Overall Benchmark Score: (5+6+1+6+7+7+8)/7 = 5.7

To enhance performance, these FSMs should consider including more states and transitions that better cover the specified scenario, thus improving state coverage, transition coverage, and cyclomatic complexity.
