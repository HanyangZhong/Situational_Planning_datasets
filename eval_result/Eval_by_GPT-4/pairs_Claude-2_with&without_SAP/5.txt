To undertake a complete analysis, I'd need the full codes for "5_3" and "5_4", along with any additional context and understanding of how actions are implemented in these states. However, I can make an initial analysis based on the information provided and the "5_best" benchmark.

FSM "5_3":

1. State Coverage: 7. It covers the necessary states but lacks states to deal with unforeseen scenarios like spilled medications.
2. Transition Coverage: 8. Transitions are well covered, but lack a verification phase after securing the medications.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 8. There are appropriate connections between states, but there aren't many fallback states in case certain actions fail.
4. Safety Mindset: 6. The safety aspect seems to be addressed, but the FSM does not detect spilled pills, which could pose a safety issue.
5. Scalability: 7. This FSM seems reasonably extendible, although new states might need to be added for complete coverage.
6. Assistance UX: 6. The FSM is functional but lacks nuanced monitoring to better adapt to changing circumstances in the bathroom.
7. Action Set Alignment: 7. The FSM adopts actions like 'close', 'gather', and 'place', which are aligned with the provided action set vocabulary.

Average: 7.0

FSM "5_4":

I cannot provide an analysis for FSM "5_4" because its code is not provided. If you could provide that, I would be able to generate a comprehensive comparison. Remember that the analysis of this kind of code requires the full context and implementation of the states and actions to provide an accurate judgement. 

Please bear in mind that this analysis could change based on external factors like the way actions are actually implemented and the robustness of the detection mechanisms in each FSM. It's also worth noting that some dimensions might have more weight than others, depending on the specific requirements of the situation.
