Sure, let's evaluate the Finite State Machines (FSM) "11_3" and "11_4" according to the mentioned seven dimensions. I'll provide scores along with descriptions for each FSM, which can be compared against FSM "11_best".

**FSM "11_3"**

1. State Coverage: 8 - FSM "11_3" includes states such as 'assess', 'retrieve', 'assist', 'check', 'monitor', but misses other important states like 'call for help＊ or ＆ensure comfort'. 
   
2. Transition Coverage: 7.5 - The FSM transitions cover several sequences, but it lacks connection from ＆check＊ state back to the 'retrieve' or 'assist' state if  the person needs additional help.
   
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6 - The FSM is simple and not highly interconnected. Each state has only one or two immediate following states.
   
4. Safety Mindset: 6 - The FSM includes assistance and monitoring, but it does not address calling for help in case the patient's conditions worsen.
   
5. Scalability: 7 - The FSM could be extended to new contexts by injecting new states and transitions, but the current setup might make it somewhat resistant.
   
6. Assistance UX: 8 - The FSM provides a natural and contextual interaction, asking if further assistance is needed and delivering necessary items.
   
7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - The FSM operates within the benchmark action set vocabulary, but includes a few additional actions such as 'open' and 'speak'.

**Overall Benchmark Score for "11_3" FSM: 7.36 (average)**

**FSM "11_4"**

1. State Coverage: 6 - FSM "11_4" covers the main states but lacks states to ensure the comfort of the person or to call for help, which are crucial in this scenario.
   
2. Transition Coverage: 6 - The FSM transitions cover some sequences, but not fully connected transitions for different scenarios.
   
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 - This FSM is simpler and less interconnected than FSM "11_best", with less follow-on state options per state.
   
4. Safety Mindset: 5 - It retrieves and delivers medicine but doesn't monitor or reassess the situation after the delivery of medicine.
   
5. Scalability: 6 - It encapsulates complexity and could have extensions, but the current structure might require considerable adjustment.
   
6. Assistance UX: 6 - The FSM prints actions as it performs tasks, making the flow of actions easy to understand but it does not cater to the comfort or monitor the status of the person.
   
7. Action Set Alignment: 6 - While the machine uses standard actions, it misses several actions from the benchmark list that could be beneficial in this scenario.

**Overall Benchmark Score for "11_4" FSM: 5.71 (average)**
