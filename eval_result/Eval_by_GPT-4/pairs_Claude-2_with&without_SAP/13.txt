Sure, I can help you analyze the Finite State Machines (FSMs) in the code "13_3" and "13_4" against the "13_best" benchmark. However, understand that some of the aspects related to user experience and scalability are beyond the scope of a program's code. I would have to make assumptions to rate them since I lack context about their use in larger systems or end-user interactions. 

Now let's analyze the FSMs:

FSM "13_3":

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - The states cover the necessary processes but lack an explicit state for verifying the occupant's wellbeing.
2. Transition Coverage: 8/10 - All states transition logically, but there is room for more preciseness like verifying whether the ventilation is sufficient before moving onto "monitor".
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10 - There are clear transitions, but some alternative or consecutive states could improve the complexity.
4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - The code ensures chemical hazards are mitigated but does not assess the wellbeing of the occupant, a central safety concern for this environment.
5. Scalability: 6/10 - The current FSM design does not seem very extendible since it lacks an explicit state for occupant interaction, which may be mandatory for similar situations.
6. Assistance UX: 6/10 - System interactions aren't very clear, and user experience might be limited due to the lack of an occupant interaction state.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - The actions align with the predefined set, but they can be more precise and explicit, such as specifically closing the chemical bottles and checking the chemical levels.

FSM "13_4":

1. State Coverage: 7/10 - The FSM includes states for assessing, mitigating, and monitoring the situation, but it lacks states for verifying the occupant wellbeing and calling for help.
2. Transition Coverage: 7/10 - Transitions exist between all the states, but they could be more explicit and detailed for better coverage.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4/10 - The FSM is straightforward with minimal interconnections between the states.
4. Safety Mindset: 7/10 - The FSM maintains safety by addressing the chemical risk but lacks explicit precautions for the occupant's safety.
5. Scalability: 6/10 - As with the previous FSM, the lack of explicit state for occupant interaction limits extendibility.
6. Assistance UX: 5/10 - Interactions could be mechanistic and lack personalization without explicit occupant interaction.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8/10 - It restricts to the defined vocabulary at a decent level, but actions can be more fine-grained.

FSM "13_3" Overall Benchmark Score: (7+8+5+7+6+6+8)/7 = 6.7 

FSM "13_4" Overall Benchmark Score: (7+7+4+7+6+5+8)/7 = 6.3

These ratings are subject to future revision since context beyond the FSM such as environment, user needs, and use-case scenarios were assumed for this assessment. The "13_best" FSM can be an ideal guide for iterating the "13_3" and "13_4" FSMs further.
