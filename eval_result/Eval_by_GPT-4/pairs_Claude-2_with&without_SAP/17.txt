Analysis for FSM "17_3":

1. State Coverage: The FSM covers all the necessary states such as initial setup, assessing the danger, redirecting the child, blocking the stairs and monitoring the child afterwards. Even calling for help if situation gets out of hand is covered, but it's limited in acknowledging the child's reaction or comfort. Score: 9/10
2. Transition Coverage: Each state is connected logically and accounts for different situations. There is no hint of the FSM getting stuck in a state due to lack of transitions. Score: 10/10 
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The complexity is relatively low. Each state has at most one or two transitions, and there are no complex interactions or loops. Score: 2/10 
4. Safety Mindset: The FSM is very safety-oriented. There's prompt action when danger is detected and even an option to call for help if the child doesn't respond by moving away from danger. Score: 10/10 
5. Scalability: The FSM is not strongly scalable as it is quite specific for this situation. Adapting it to another scenario would require significant changes. Score: 4/10 
6. Assistance UX: There is no provision for user interaction or customizable options. The FSM carries out the necessary steps automatically. Score: 6/10 
7. Action Set Alignment: A lot of the actions correspond with the provided action set vocabulary. It includes assessing, carrying("Transporting"), blocking("Placing down") etc. Hence, it has a decent score. Score: 8/10 

Overall Score: (9+10+2+10+4+6+8)/7 = 7.0 

Analysis for FSM "17_4":

1. State Coverage: The FSM covers all the required states like the "17_3" FSM. However, it also accounts for child's comfort (calm state), giving it an edge. Score: 10/10 
2. Transition Coverage: The FSM transitions between states logically, and includes specific transitions to manage safety well. Score: 10/10 
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: As with "17_3", each state has one or two transitions. Complexity is low. Score: 2/10 
4. Safety Mindset: Safety is strongly kept in mind with constant risk assessment and specific actions to prevent harm like moving the child away, blocking stairs and calming the child. Score: 10/10 
5. Scalability: The additional state to comfort the child makes it slightly more adaptable to situations where comforting is necessary, though it is still relatively focused on one particular scenario. Score: 5/10 
6. Assistance UX: This FSM also lacks user interaction or customization. But the addition of calming and explaining actions provide better experience. Score: 7/10 
7. Action Set Alignment: The actions align well with the provided set. Actions include, moving, blocking, comforting, explaining, continually checking etc. Score: 9/10 

Overall Score: (10+10+2+10+5+7+9)/7 = 7.6

Comparison with the "17_best":
- Both "17_3" & "17_4" lack the state interconnectivity of the "17_best", which impacts their cyclomatic complexity scores. 
- The "17_4" variation does a better job covering all necessary states with the addition of 'comforting the child' state. 
- Both alternatives are less scalable than the "17_best" as they are closely tied to this specific scenario.
- Where UX is concerned, '17_best' is superior because of it's more personalized approach, while both alternatives function pretty automatically.
- In terms of safety, "17_3" and "17_4" match up well with "17_best" as all avoid disaster actively and involve humans if necessary.
- The action set alignment in both alternatives is good, though "17_4" performs slightly better. 

Based on this analysis, while the two FSM alternatives perform decently well, there's room for improving cyclomatic complexity, scalability and UX to match up to our benchmark "17_best".
