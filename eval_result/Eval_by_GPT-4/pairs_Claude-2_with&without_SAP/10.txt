To create a comparative analysis of the provided FSMs, I will first provide a brief summary of each FSM. Following this, I will analyze each FSM across the seven dimensions and provide scores accordingly.

FSM "10_3"(ButlerRobot):
This FSM is designed with safety in mind, but focuses on pool safety rather than mobility challenges. It shows a limited set of states and transitions where it mainly cycles between covering a pool and engaging with children. It does not tackle the issue of clearing mobility obstacles.

FSM "10_4":
This finite state machine has a set of interactive states where a robot approaches a person, offers help, moves an obstructing chair, and confirms access. However, it is very narrowly focused and lacks the complexity and depth necessary to handle a wider variety of scenarios.

Before starting the scores, note that 10 represents a perfect match to the "10_best" FSM, and 0 implies a major divergence or lack of subtlety.

Ratings for FSM "10_3":

1. State Coverage: 3 - It lacks the necessary states to handle a varied range of scenarios, especially the presented scenario.
2. Transition Coverage: 5 - While it has transitions, they are not connected to handle scenarios outside of those specified.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 2 - This FSM is simple with few states and immediate transitions.
4. Safety Mindset: 8 - While it lacks in other areas, it does demonstrate a safety-first approach with its emphasis on pool safety and child safety.
5. Scalability: 2 - The FSM is not designed for easy scalability or modification with new additions.
6. Assistance UX: 4 - This system is designed for generic actions rather than personalized experiences.
7. Action Set Alignment: 4 - Many actions are not strictly defined or aligned with the established benchmark set.

Overall Benchmark Score for "10_3": (3+5+2+8+2+4+4)/7 = 4

Ratings for FSM "10_4":

1. State Coverage: 6 - It's covered some necessary states related to the person-to-robot interaction and obstacle removal.
2. Transition Coverage: 7 - The FSM has a sequence of fully connected state transitions, despite being a simple sequence.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 3 - This FSM is simple with straightforward state transitions.
4. Safety Mindset: 6 - The FSM includes actions to clear paths and ensure the user's safety, though it does not explicitly address all safety concerns.
5. Scalability: 4 - Modifying the FSM for different scenarios would require additional states and transitions, hence difficult to scale.
6. Assistance UX: 8 - The FSM focuses on interaction and assistance, hence providing a good user experience.
7. Action Set Alignment: 5 - The FSM uses general action verbs without strictly adhering to the established action set, though it does seem to align with the overall spirit of the actions.

Overall Benchmark Score for "10_4": (6+7+3+6+4+8+5)/7 = 5.57

In conclusion, while both FSMs manage to embed some dimensions of the "10_best" FSM they both fall short in fully matching its robustness, complexity, and across all dimensions of the home assistance scenario. However, based on their Overall Benchmark Scores, FSM "10_4" performed comparatively better than FSM "10_3".
