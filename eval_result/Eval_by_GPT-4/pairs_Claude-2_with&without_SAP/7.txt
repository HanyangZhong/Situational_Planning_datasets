Analysis of "7_3" FSM:
1. State Coverage: The FSM covers most of the necessary states, though it lacks states specifically for arranging shoes, straightening the rug, and handling the lamp cord, which were present in "7_best". Score: 7
2. Transition Coverage: Transitions between states are clear and logical, but some potential sequences, like the possibility of transitioning back to assessment after removing hazards, are missing. Score: 7
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM follows a straightforward path, with no interconnection between states, leading to lesser complexity. Score: 2
4. Safety Mindset: The FSM focuses on safety, clearing the pathway and securing items, though without the specificity of "7_best". Score: 7
5. Scalability: With a more generic structure, this FSM could be easily extended to handle new situations, but lacks specialized states of "7_best". Score: 8
6. Assistance UX: The FSM provides assistant-like behaviors, but doesn't provide any contextual or personalized user experience. Score: 5
7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM uses limited action verbs within the industry benchmark list. Score: 4 

Overall Benchmark Score for "7_3": Average (7+7+2+7+8+5+4)/7 = 5.7

Analysis of "7_4" FSM:
1. State Coverage: This FSM incorporates a broad range of states related to the scenario and closely aligns with "7_best". However, it lacks states for arranging shoes and calling for help. Score: 8
2. Transition Coverage: It's well interconnected, with most states capable of transitioning back to the assess state if hazards are detected during monitoring, but it does not cover transitioning to all states. Score: 7
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM shows more complexity with multiple pathways leading back to the assess state. Score: 5
4. Safety Mindset: The FSM shows a good safety mindset, addressing various aspects of the scenario including the bunched rug and lamp cord. Score: 9
5. Scalability: The FSM's modular nature allows for the addition of new states to address different scenarios. Score: 8
6. Assistance UX: This FSM provides a more natural, contextual, and user-friendly experience with descriptive print statements. Score: 7
7. Action Set Alignment: This FSM incorporates a moderate range of actions from the benchmark list but could utilize more. Score: 6 

Overall Benchmark Score for "7_4": Average (8+7+5+9+8+7+6)/7 = 7.1
