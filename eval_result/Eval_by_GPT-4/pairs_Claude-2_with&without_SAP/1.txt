Alright, based on the codes you've provided, here's the analysis for the Finite State Machines (FSMs) for "1_3" and "1_4". We'll measure the FSMs on 7 dimensions and compare them against "1_best". 

Note: Potential range of scores is 0-10 in each category. 

FSM "1_3" Analysis:
1. State Coverage: 8. FSM "1_3" covers essential states but does not have a state for monitoring the bathroom for future mess or a final check-up. 
2. Transition Coverage: 8. The transitions cover most likely sequences but work on a one time cleaning pass with no provision to loop back.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 4. There is a direct sequence of states, with no branches.
4. Safety Mindset: 8. The FSM does remove hazards like the wet mat and manages displaced items. However, it lacks periodic monitoring for ongoing safety.
5. Scalability: 6. The FSM could be extended to new contexts, but the lack of monitoring and final check-up states limits its adaptability.
6. Assistance UX: 6. The FSM focuses on tasks without considering the user's experience, such as prioritising user's privacy and convenience.
7. Action Set Alignment: 10. All the actions used in this FSM can be mapped to the defined action set. 

FSM "1_3" Overall Benchmark Score: 7.1

FSM "1_4" Analysis:
1. State Coverage: 9. FSM "1_4" appropriately covers nearly all the necessary states. However, there's no state for dealing with new spills or routine checks.
2. Transition Coverage: 9. It covers most of the probable sequences and has a better handling of the various situations.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5. More interconnection compared to "1_3", allowing the FSM to loop back to the 'assess' state if more tasks are detected.
4. Safety Mindset: 10. The FSM performs actions to resolve many potential hazards in the bathroom.
5. Scalability: 7. The FSM structure allows for the introduction of new states and transitions. However, it is somewhat tied to specific tasks.
6. Assistance UX: 8. The FSM improves UX by assessing the bathroom and dealing with any detected task in order of their detection.
7. Action Set Alignment: 10. All actions are in line with the defined action set.

FSM "1_4" Overall Benchmark Score: 8.3

Overall, the "1_4" FSM performs better by properly covering necessary states and transitions, including routine cleaning tasks, and handling safety aspects well. While both FSM's align completely with the defined action set, the "1_3" FSM lacks complexity and scales less well to new contexts.
