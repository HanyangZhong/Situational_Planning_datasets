Sure, here's an evaluation for FSM 11_3:

1. State Coverage: FSM 11_3 has 6 states, which include all the necessary states to handle the scene, such as assessing the person's situation, retrieving the medicine, assisting the person, monitoring the person, and calling for help if necessary. Therefore, it has high state coverage. (9/10)
2. Transition Coverage: This FSM does well in terms of transition coverage as well. It has clearly defined transitions between states based on the person's needs and the robot's actions. However, the transition from the 'RETRIEVE_MEDICINE' state to 'ASSIST_PERSON' state lacks flexibility if the 'grasping' action fails, so I'll deduct a point here. (9/10)
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The complexity of the FSM is quite manageable. Each state has a clear transition path, making the complexity appropriate for this use case. However, it lacks interconnectivity between states without sufficient conditions to return to the initial or monitoring state. (7/10)
4. Safety Mindset: This FSM shows a good safety mindset, especially with states like 'ASSESS_SITUATION' and 'CALL_FOR_HELP'. However, it might fail to react appropriately if an error occurs when retrieving medicine. (9/10)
5. Scalability: The FSM is structured and modular, which makes it extendible to new contexts. But the state transitions could be more generalized to improve its scalability. (8/10)
6. Assistance UX: The user experience appears decent although there's no explicit personalization or context-awareness in this FSM. The actions are robotic and based on a specific scenario. (7/10)
7. Action Set Alignment: Given the action set vocabulary, the FSM uses actions such as 'reaching', 'grasping', 'monitoring', and 'calling for help', aligning well with the defined action set. (9/10)

The overall benchmark score for FSM 11_3 is the average of the above scores: (9+9+7+9+8+7+9)/7 = ~8.43.

Now for FSM 11_4:

1. State Coverage: FSM 11_4 also covers all the necessary states for this scenario - assessing the situation, retrieving the medicine, assisting the person, monitoring the condition, and calling for help. (9/10)
2. Transition Coverage: This FSM has well-defined transitions between the states. However, like FSM 11_3, it lacks flexibility in the transition from the 'RETRIEVE_MEDICINE' to 'ASSIST_PERSON' state. (9/10)
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM is less complex and direct in its approach, almost linear. It also lacks interconnectivity with limited conditions for state changes. (6/10)
4. Safety Mindset: FSM 11_4 also maintains a good safety mindset with 'ASSESS_SITUATION', 'MONITOR_CONDITION', and 'CALL_FOR_HELP' states. (9/10)
5. Scalability: While FSM 11_4 has a linear structure that might make it easy to understand, the linearity could limit its scalability and ability to handle more complex situations. (7/10)
6. Assistance UX: User experience is considered decent. The person is assisted in a timely manner depending on their state, but there's still a lack of personalization or context-awareness. (7/10)
7. Action Set Alignment: This FSM utilizes the defined action set effectively. It uses actions like 'grasping', 'delivering', 'monitoring', and 'calling'. (9/10)

The overall benchmark score for FSM 11_4 is: (9+9+6+9+7+7+9)/7 = ~8.

Both FSMs do very well under this evaluation, with minor points to be improved for each. FSM 11_3 gets higher scores in terms of cyclomatic complexity and scalability, while both of them have similar scores for the other dimensions.
