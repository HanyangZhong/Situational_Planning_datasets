I will evaluate and provide scores for FSM code "2_3" and "2_4" against the established benchmark "2_best". Please note that it's understood the codes do not have an actual execution environment and scores are based on the definitions and transitions provided in the pseudocodes.

For FSM "2_3":

1. State Coverage: This FSM covers most necessary states based on the scenario, however, it seems to lack an explicit state to monitor the kitchen for new spills or changes after initial situation is handled. I will give a score of **8**.
   
2. Transition Coverage: FSM "2_3" connects well between stages with logical transition from one state to the next. However, it lacks the transition from "FINALIZE" to "ASSESS_SITUATION" for continuous operation. Therefore, I would score this a **7**.
   
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: It's not overly complex with each state leading to one or two others, allowing for easier debugging and maintenance. So, I will give a score of **8**.

4. Safety Mindset: The FSM demonstrates a safety mindset by securing the spill area, checking the pot for safety and calling for human help when necessary. But securing the area before assessing whether the pot is safe might leave potential hazards, so the score is **7**.

5. Scalability: The FSM shows a decent amount of scalability as each state is its own function, meaning new states can easily be added. However, the structure might require a significant overhaul for substantial changes. This results in a **7**.

6. Assistance UX: While it does make an effort to assess hazards and take appropriate steps, there's no explicit interaction with users mentioned. It would benefit from personalized communication with the user during operation, thus scoring is **6**.

7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM sticks relatively close to the given action set, but also introduces additional actions such as "reminding" and "mixing". Giving it a score of **7**.

Calculating the Overall Benchmark Score for FSM "2_3": (8+7+8+7+7+6+7)/7= **7.14**  

For FSM "2_4":

1. State Coverage: The FSM covers all the necessary states for the given scenario. Therefore, it gets a score of **9**.

2. Transition Coverage: Each state seems to transition logically to the next and it has coverage for returning from "FINAL_CHECK" to "ASSESS_SITUATION" for continuous monitoring. It scores **9**.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Like "2_3", this FSM isn't overly complex, each state leading to only one or two others. Therefore, I would score this a **9**.

4. Safety Mindset: Safety seems to be a priority with the FSM securing pets and managing the spill, but like "2_3" it secures pets after handling the spill which could be a potential safety concern. I'd give it a **8**.

5. Scalability: It's decent at separating concerns, making it relatively straightforward to add new states or actions. Therefore, it gets a **8**.

6. Assistance UX: Much like FSM "2_3", FSM "2_4" does not demonstrate clear communication or interaction with humans. It would benefit from acknowledging and informing the user during operation, scoring it **6**.

7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM mostly sticks to provided action set, but also introduces some additional actions outside of the defined set such as "removing". Therefore, I would score it a **7**.

Calculating the Overall Benchmark Score for FSM "2_4": (9+9+9+8+8+6+7)/7= **8** 

Please note that these scores are based on relative comparison against the "2_best" FSM and the real-world feasibility of these FSMs may vary.
