Here's an analysis of FSMs in both "21_3" and "21_4" across the seven dimensions, using "21_best" as a benchmark:

1. "21_3" FSM Analysis:

   State Coverage: 9
   FSM "21_3" has good coverage of necessary states. While missing separate states for assessing injuries and providing specific help based on assessed needs, it does cover major scenarios like assessing the situation, reaching the button, calling for help, assisting the person, and monitoring the situation.

   Transition Coverage: 8
   The FSM covers all the critical transitions, although the back-and-forth flow might lead to unnecessary repetition (e.g., ongoing transitions between 'ASSIST_PERSON' and 'MONITOR_SITUATION').

   Cyclomatic Complexity: 5
   The FSM has a decent flow but could improve its complexity.

   Safety Mindset: 9
   The FSM includes immediate reactions to the detection of the fall, such as reaching for the emergency button and calling for help. However, it might not assess potential injuries or patient’s conditions right away.

   Scalability: 7
   More granular states for case-by-case assistance might ease future enhancements.

   Assistance UX: 8
   Assisting the person on the floor by lifting and placing them in a safe position provides a comforting user experience, but there might be a lack of personalized actions as per the assessment of the person's condition.

   Action Set Alignment: 8
   Most actions align with the standard action set, although it includes 'lifting,' which isn't on the list.

   Average Overall Benchmark Score for "21_3": 7.7

2. "21_4" FSM Analysis:

   State Coverage: 9.5
   FSM "21_4" covers a wide range of the necessary states. Additional states like 'ENSURE_COMFORT' are commendable, though it lacks a state for injuries assessment.

   Transition Coverage: 9
   Its transitions cover most sequences but might need additional checks in between emergency button reach and personal assistance.

   Cyclomatic Complexity: 6
   The FSM manages complexity well but handles specific conditions within the state, which could increase complexity in a more extensive FSM.

   Safety Mindset: 9.5
   It follows a safe practice starting with situation assessment and ending with continuous monitoring. It also includes measures such as ensuring comfort.

   Scalability: 8.5
   The FSM separates actions and conditions into different states, which could ease future enhancements.

   Assistance UX: 9
   It provides the ability to ensure the comfort of the person, demonstrating a more focused approach to the patient's comfort and well-being.

   Action Set Alignment: 8
   Most actions align with the standard action set, although it includes 'lifting,' which isn't on the list.

   Average Overall Benchmark Score for "21_4": 8.6 


In conclusion, both FSMs manage the situation well, reducing the risk to the dependent individual. However, there is always room for improvement, especially concerning safety, scalability, and alignment with the defined action set. Please note that these scores are rough estimates – the actual values may change slightly depending on the details of the assistance potential and subsequent tests.
