Analyzing FSM "20_3":
1. State Coverage: The FSM covers the necessary states like assessing situation, providing assistance, retrieving the device, activating the device, and calling for help. It does not explicitly state monitoring of the environment or waiting for response and assisting human helpers as seen in "20_best". Score: 7
2. Transition Coverage: The FSM ensures a logical flow between states, initiating from the assessment and looping back to the initial state after actions are performed. However, it does not consider whether help arrives or not. Score: 7
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM's states are not densely interconnected and it follows a linear structure; each state has only one following state, making it simple and straightforward. Score: 3
4. Safety Mindset: This FSM takes the elderly person's condition into consideration at every step, indicating an adequate focus on safety. However, it doesn't explicitly account for situations in which help is delayed. Score: 8
5. Scalability: The FSM is simple and segmented, which makes it scalable and allows for easy modification when needed. Score: 9
6. Assistance UX: The FSM involves the user in multiple steps, particularly in assessing the situation, and provides assistance accordingly. The incorporation of regular checks improves user experience. Score: 9
7. Action Set Alignment: This FSM uses a mixture of actions from the standard list like assessing, calling, activating etc. though some actions like "asking", "dialing" etc are not strictly from the list. The difference comes mostly from semantics and interpretation. Score: 8
Overall Benchmark Score for FSM "20_3": (7+7+3+8+9+9+8)/7 = 7.28

Analyzing FSM "20_4":
1. State Coverage: Similar to "20_3", it lacks explicit states for environment monitoring, waiting for response and assisting human helpers. However, it adds an 'approach_elderly' state which maps to real-world actions of the butler robot. Score: 8
2. Transition Coverage: The transitions are logically connected and integrated, forming a coherent FSM, but again it does not consider whether help arrives or not. Score: 7
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM's states are not densely interconnected, transitioning linearly from one state to the next. Score: 3
4. Safety Mindset: The focus on elderly safety is paramount based on the state interactions indicated. It could be improved by inculcating contingencies if external help is delayed. Score: 8
5. Scalability: Its streamlined structure would permit the addition of new states or actions if required, hence is quite scalable. Score: 9
6. Assistance UX: This FSM explicitly includes a state for approaching the elderly before taking action, which could enhance UX by making the assistance seem more attentive. Score: 9
7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM sticks to using the action sets from the industry benchmarklist, such as 'approaching', 'reaching', 'activating' etc. There's a slight diversion in terms like 'is_elderly_stable' but overall alignment is good. Score: 9
Overall Benchmark Score for FSM "20_4": (8+7+3+8+9+9+9)/7 = 7.57

In comparison to the "20_best" FSM, both "20_3" and "20_4" miss on few steps but overall they manage a good implementation of FSM for the given scenario. "20_4" performs slightly better due to its close alignment with actions from the industry benchmark list and its explicit inclusion of approaching the elderly into the FSM.
