For clarity, let's analyze and rate each FSM code separately. The rating is based on a 0 to 10 scale, 10 being the highest score and 0 the lowest.

**FSM Code: "22_3"**

1. State Coverage: The FSM has covered all of the necessary states such as assessing the situation, reaching the alert button, assisting the woman, and calling for help. However, it lacks a detailed monitoring state that would be beneficial for constant checking on the woman's condition and the overall situation. For this reason, I would score it an **8**.
2. Transition Coverage: The transitions inside this FSM seem to logically cover the different sequences that might occur in the described situation, hence, a score of **8**.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The level of interconnectivity in "22_3" is moderate - there are clear transitions between states without extensive interconnectivity. For a situation of moderate complexity, this isn't a bad approach. Rate it as **7**. 
4. Safety Mindset: This FSM shows a clear concern for safety, as demonstrated by its intent to reach the alert button and call for help when necessary. However, it lacks a monitoring system to keep the situation under control until help arrives. I'd rate this as an **8**.
5. Scalability: The structure of this FSM could easily be extended to new contexts, as it logically separates distinct actions such as assessing the situation, reaching for the alert button, assisting the woman, and calling for help. Rating: **9**.
6. Assistance UX: As for the user experience, the FSM doesn't provide a continuous assessment of the woman's condition, and it misses a step to reassure or comfort her, which could negatively impact the user experience. Hence, a score of **7**.
7. Action Set Alignment: The code is designed with actions mainly from the given list, with actions like 'reaching', 'pressing', 'monitoring', 'responding', and 'calling for help' being used. Score: **10**.

Average rating for "22_3": (8+8+7+8+9+7+10)/7 = **8.14**

**FSM Code: "22_4"**

1. State Coverage: This FSM covers a wide range of state, from assessing the situation, assisting the woman, activating the alert, to monitoring the situation and calling for help. I'd rate it as a **10**.
2. Transition Coverage: "22_4" covers all the critical scenarios in the transitions, which are well defined and connected. Rate it as **10**.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: The FSM has a clear flow with reasonable complexity but not overly complex which makes it easy to understand and manage. I'd rate it as **8**.
4. Safety Mindset: This FSM shows a strong concern for safety with actions specific to the woman's safety, activating the alert, and monitoring the situation continuously. Rate: **10**.
5. Scalability: With clearly defined states and transitions, the FSM can be easily extended to include more states or actions if required, hence, a score of **9**.
6. Assistance UX: The overall user experience will be good as the FSM ensures help arrives swiftly. However, like "22_3" it also lacks a state to provide comfort which can negatively influence the user experience. I'd rate it as an **8**.
7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM restricts itself to the provided action set vocabulary which makes it easy to understand the exact implementation details. Thus a score of **10**.

Average rating for "22_4": (10+10+8+10+9+8+10)/7 = **9.29**

In conclusion, while "22_3" and "22_4" both follow the helpful guidance of "22_best" quite well, "22_4" shows a better performance in terms of state coverage, transition coverage, safety mindset and action set alignment. Although, both FSMs could improve their Assistance UX by incorporating actions to comfort and reassure the woman while help arrives.
