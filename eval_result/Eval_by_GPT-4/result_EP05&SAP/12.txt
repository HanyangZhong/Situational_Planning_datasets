### 1. Analysis for "12_3" FSM

**State Coverage**: The "12_3" FSM covers most of the necessary states but lacks a state that could handle the straightening of the rug, a mentioned hazard in the scenario. The states present are INITIAL, ASSESS_SITUATION, REMOVE_HAZARDS, MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT, ASSIST_WOMAN, and CALL_FOR_HELP. Score: 8

**Transition Coverage**: The FSM has fully connected transitions, but the transition from REMOVE_HAZARDS to MONITOR_ENVIRONMENT doesn't consider the scenario when the robot finishes clearing another hazard(s) and needs to assess the situation again. Score: 8.5

**Cyclomatic Complexity**: This FSM has a balanced complexity with each state connected to others as per the requirements. However, it lacks the flexibility for more direct transitions between some states. Score: 7

**Safety Mindset**: The FSM is designed with a safety-first approach, it monitors the environment, detects, and removes hazards. However, it lacks precise detection with rug as a hazard. Score: 9

**Scalability**: The FSM can be easily extended to include new states and transitions because of its modular structure, but it may require some changes in the transition logic when removing hazards. Score: 8

**Assistance UX**: The FSM offers assistance to the woman and has a state dedicated to calling for emergency services. Nonetheless, according to the scenario, there is no state that considers assisting the woman in moving around the cluttered space. Score: 7.5

**Action Set Alignment**: While the FSM uses an appropriate set of actions like collecting, placing down, and straightening, it doesn't fully utilize the provided action set vocabulary. It tends to construct more simplistic actions lacking diversity from the list. Score: 7

**Overall Benchmark Score for "12_3" FSM**: Average of the dimension scores = (8 + 8.5 + 7 + 9 + 8 + 7.5 + 7) / 7 = 7.9

### 2. Analysis for "12_4" FSM

**State Coverage**: The "12_4" FSM adequately covers the necessary states of INITIAL, IDENTIFY_HAZARDS, MITIGATE_HAZARDS, ENSURE_SAFETY, and CALL_FOR_HELP. However, it lacks a dedicated state for assisting the woman and for those specific hazards like toys and curled rug. Score: 7

**Transition Coverage**: The FSM has complete and logical transitions among all its states, but it again lacks direct transitions for tackling specific hazards. Score: 8

**Cyclomatic Complexity**: This FSM also has balanced complexity and each state has been linked to other states as per the requirement. The complexity is sufficient for the problem it is intended to solve. Score: 7.5

**Safety Mindset**: The FSM shows a strong safety orientation by identifying and mitigating hazards, and ensuring ongoing safety. However, it doesn't have a specific focus on helping the pregnant woman navigate the space safely. Score: 7.5

**Scalability**: While the FSM has built with scalability in mind, adding more hazard-specific and assistance states would require significant changes. Score: 7

**Assistance UX**: The FSM lacks a state for offering assistance to the woman directly, and this can affect the user experience severely in this particular scenario. Score: 6

**Action Set Alignment**: This FSM uses fewer actions from the provided action set vocabulary, relying on more general actions for organizing hazards with less specific descriptions. Score: 6.5

**Overall Benchmark Score for "12_4" FSM**: Average of the dimension scores = (7 + 8 + 7.5 + 7.5 + 7 + 6 + 6.5) / 7 = 7.1

In conclusion, both FSMs "12_3" and "12_4" perform reasonably well, but have room for improvement in terms of overall state coverage, user experience, and action set alignment. Compared to the "12_best" FSM, they tend to lack specific focus on handling all variations of hazards and offering specialized assistance to the woman in the scenario.
