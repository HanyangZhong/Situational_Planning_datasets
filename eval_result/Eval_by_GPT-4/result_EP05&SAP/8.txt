Analysis of FSM in the code "8_3":
1. State Coverage: The FSM covers most states necessary to handle the case: assessing the situation, handling the drawer, rearranging the knives, and monitoring the situation. However, it doesn't account for certain steps such as a final check or specific state for secure knives. It also does not cover the situation when things do not go as planned such as a "CALL_FOR_HELP" state in the "8_best" FSM. Therefore, it gets a score of 7.
2. Transition Coverage: The FSM has a logical flow and covers likely state sequences, but lacks transitions for unexpected scenarios. Unlike the "8_best" FSM, there are no transitions from the action states to a safety check or failure scenario. That gives it a score of 6.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Compared to the "8_best" FSM, this FSM is less complex and gives fewer options for transitions from one state to another. Most states have one immediately following state, so it gets a score of 4.
4. Safety Mindset: The FSM considers safety by rearranging the knives properly and monitoring the situation. However, it doesn't have a separate state dedicated for ensuring the knives are secured safely. Therefore, a score of 7 is given.
5. Scalability: The FSM is organized and easy to extend, but still lacks some flexibility in handling unexpected situations. It scores 7 for scalability.
6. Assistance UX: The FSM provides a good UX, ensuring safety and constantly monitoring the situation. However, it lacks the ability to dynamically respond based on changes in the environment. So, a score of 6.
7. Action Set Alignment: The FSM uses actions like "opening", "rearranging", "closing", and "monitoring". These are from the established verb list and keeps the FSM consistent. It scores 10 on this.

Overall benchmark score for "8_3": (7+6+4+7+7+6+10)/7 = 6.71

Analysis of FSM in the code "8_4":
1. State Coverage: The FSM covers almost all necessary states: assessing the situation, dealing with the hazard, ensuring safety, and continuously monitoring the kitchen. It has more specific state coverage than "8_3", resembling "8_best". It scores 9.
2. Transition Coverage: This FSM offers a good transition coverage including the transitions for dealing with new detected hazards. However, it lacks condition for terminating the FSM in the event of an unsolvable issue. Therefore, a score of 9 is given.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: While the FSM is not as intricate as "8_best", it intricately follows a sequence of states and offers a sensible complexity for the situation at hand - score 7.
4. Safety Mindset: This FSM has strong safety mindset, incorporates checks for potential hazards, and even includes "child-proofing". So, it scores 10.
5. Scalability: FSM is easily extendable and adaptable to new situations including detecting new hazards and calling for human assistance. It scores 8 for scalability.
6. Assistance UX: The FSM's adherence to safety, monitoring, and responsiveness provides a good user interface. It lacks personalization though. It scores 8.
7. Action Set Alignment: Like "8_3", this FSM also utilizes actions from the given list like closing, opening, rearranging, checking, installing, and calling and gets a score of 10.

Overall benchmark score for "8_4": (9+9+7+10+8+8+10)/7 = 8.71

Note: The above analysis and scores are based on the information and FSMs provided, some qualitative judgement is inevitable.
