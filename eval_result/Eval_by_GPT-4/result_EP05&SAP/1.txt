Here are the evaluations for both FSM "1_3" and "1_4":

FSM "1_3"

1. State Coverage: 8. This FSM covers majority of the necessary states, but fails to consider closing the shower or clearing the steam, as the were covered in the "1_best" FSM.
2. Transition Coverage: 7. Most of the likely sequences are covered but the FSM misses a re-checking mechanism after each task to ensure that tasks done haven't affected previous state.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6. The FSM consists of each state having a single immediately following state, which minimizes complexity but may not be able to handle more complex situations.
4. Safety Mindset: 8. This FSM pretty well covers the safety considerations like drying the floor and arranging the bath mat. But it does not consider checking if the shower is properly closed which is a safety concern.
5. Scalability: 8. The state and transition setup in this FSM lends itself fairly well to extendibility to new contexts, though it may need revisiting for more complex environments.
6. Assistance UX: 8. The user experience seems natural and adaptive to the scenario, with tasks being handled one after the other in a logical manner. However, the FSM does not account for unexpected changes that may happen after a task is completed.
7. Action Set Alignment: 9. Almost all actions in the FSM are from the defined action set vocabulary. Some additional or custom actions may have been introduced such as "placing down".

Overall Benchmark Score: (8+7+6+8+8+8+9)/7 = 7.7

FSM "1_4"

1. State Coverage: 9. This FSM includes a state for each necessary task in the scenario. However, it lacks a state for checking if the shower is closed.
2. Transition Coverage: 7. There is a clear pathway and a check after each cleaning task. However, the model may not handle all possible sequences depending on the actual state of the bathroom, such as when a cleaning task undoes a completed task.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6. Each state in this FSM has only one immediately following state, simplifying the pathway but limiting the ability to handle more complex scenarios.
4. Safety Mindset: 9. It considers safety with the drying of the floor, the proper handling of the bath mat, and the hanging of the towel. However, not checking the shower is a potential omission.
5. Scalability: 7. The FSM seems scalable given each state is independent, but complex environments or new contexts may require more states and transitions.
6. Assistance UX: 9. High score due to handling tasks sequentially and checking the bathroom state after each cleaning task but it doesn't provide for unexpected changes that happen after the completion of a task.
7. Action Set Alignment: 9. The FSM adheres to the list of action verbs provided, using them to define actions in the code.

Overall Benchmark Score: (9+7+6+9+7+9+9)/7 = 8.1

With the slightly higher Overall Benchmark Score and better alignment of actions, FSM "1_4" performs better compared to "1_3". Both models, however, are lacking in assessing safety with respect to the shower status, which was present in "1_best". The models could also benefit from additional complexity to handle potential varying sequences and unexpected changes in the bathroom state.
