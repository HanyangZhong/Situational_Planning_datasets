Based on the information provided and analysis of the mentioned FSMs, here are the scores for the FSMs in both "3_3" and "3_4" code. 

**Scoring for "3_3"**

1. **State Coverage:** 6 - It covers major states but lacks an initial state and does not include conditions where the room is occupied or not.
2. **Transition Coverage:** 6 - Transitions exist between all stages but there's a scenario to jump back to monitoring safety after extinguishing the candle, assuming the candle could be lit up again. Also, it could lack of logical checks in situations.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 5 - There is an average degree of interconnectivity between states but could be more sophisticated.
4. **Safety Mindset:** 7 - It has considered different aspects of safety, such as sensing the proximity of the candle to books, but could improve by considering more safety-related situations.
5. **Scalability:** 6 - The FSM can be extended to newer contexts, but it does not consider more complex scenarios or contexts.
6. **Assistance UX:** 6 - The FSM supports some natural and contextual functions but could improve on creating more personalized experiences.
7. **Action Set Alignment:** 7 - The FSM selects actions from the defined action set vocabulary. However, it might need additional actions to handle potential unforeseen circumstances.

**Overall Benchmark Score for "3_3":** 6.1 out of 10

**Scoring for "3_4"**

1. **State Coverage:** 7 - It correctly transitions between different states including many necessary states. However, there is no state for verifying success (if the candle was extinguished).
2. **Transition Coverage:** 7 - Transitions cover likely sequences, but it lacks a way to cycle back to initial states after extinguishing the candle.
3. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 6 - The FSM is not unnecessarily complex but could provide more interconnectivity for handling complicated situations.
4. **Safety Mindset:** 8 - This FSM goes a step further in considering safety by including a cleaning state. However, more safety checks could be included.
5. **Scalability:** 8 - It looks extendable to new contexts by having mostly encapsulated states with clear responsibilities.
6. **Assistance UX:** 7 - It covers varied scenarios that would provide a somewhat natural user experience. However, personalization aspects could be improved.
7. **Action Set Alignment:** 8 - The FSM uses various actions from the defined action set vocabulary quite effectively.

**Overall Benchmark Score for "3_4":** 7.3 out of 10
