Let's evaluate the FSMs "10_3" and "10_4" based on the criteria you've set in comparison with "10_best".

FSM "10_3":
1. State Coverage: 8 - All necessary states are covered, but there doesn't seem to be a state to handle unexpected obstacles after the initial clearing of the path.
2. Transition Coverage: 8 - Transitions between states are generally well considered, but it lacks transitions back to 'clear path' state from 'assist user' or 'monitor room' in case new obstacles appear.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - The concept of the FSM is simple and easy to follow, not overly complex but maybe a little too simplistic for full real-world application.
4. Safety Mindset: 9 - The robot is designed to assist and monitor the user, and call for human assistance if needed, which indicates a strong safety mindset.
5. Scalability: 8 - New states and transitions could be added but would require some modification of the existing structure.
6. Assistance UX: 7 - The FSM covers necessary tasks for the given scenario, but it seems to lack the capability to respond to unexpected changes in the environment.
7. Action Set Alignment: 7 - The FSM uses actions from the given set but not all of them, e.g. it could employ more actions for in-depth environment monitoring.
Overall Benchmark Score: 7.7 (average of the above)

FSM "10_4":
1. State Coverage: 9 - Covers all necessary states, including assessing the situation, removing obstruction, assisting user, and even continuous monitoring.
2. Transition Coverage: 9 - Transitions are well defined, including checks for user readiness and if further intervention is needed.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 7 - FSM is designed to be simple and easy to understand, which is good, but may lack the density of interaction between states for complex scenarios.
4. Safety Mindset: 9 - The FSM checks if the user is ready to move before assisting, and continues to monitor the environment, showing a safety-conscious design.
5. Scalability: 8 - The FSM seems extendable, with well-defined states and transitions. However, being quite specific to the given scenario, scaling to other contexts may require additional work.
6. Assistance UX: 8 - Provides considerate assistance to the user, constantly checks the user's state, but may lack responses to non-ideal scenarios.
7. Action Set Alignment: 8 - The FSM employs actions from the list given, but doesn't seem to fully utilize all possible actions.
Overall Benchmark Score: 8.3 (average of the above)

Conclusively, in relation to the "10_best", both "10_3" and "10_4" FSMs exhibit a commendable performance yet require enhancements in several dimensions. "10_4" scored slightly higher, proving itself more effective than "10_3" in this comparison. Adjustments to improve transition coverage and better alignment with action set could significantly increase both FSMs' performance.
