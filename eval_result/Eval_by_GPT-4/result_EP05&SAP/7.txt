Your analysis will require the FSMs from 7_3 and 7_4. You've requested to rate these on seven dimensions anchored to 7_best with perfect 10s. I will base my analysis on the text of the code you provided, since, as a text-based AI, I can't evaluate actual running code, surveillance of real-world scenarios, or experiences of users interacting with robotic devices.

FSM from code "7_3":

1. State Coverage: 8/10. It adequately encompasses most states represented in the 7_best code, although it misses specific states for securing the lamp cord and continuously monitoring the hallway, making it less comprehensive.
2. Transition Coverage: 7/10. Transitions exist between all states, albeit this model misses a transition back to the 'CLEAN_HALLWAY' state after 'REARRANGE_SHOES' to reflect the iterative nature of real-world cleaning.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 5/10. Complexity is slightly lower, with each state having at most one potential following state, excluding self-transitions.
4. Safety Mindset: 8/10. Safety enforcement is evident but isn't as rigorous as in 7_best as there's no provision for constant monitoring of hallways for new hazards.
5. Scalability: 8/10. The FSM is modular, allowing additions, though the absence of a monitoring state could hinder extending it to dynamic environments.
6. Assistance UX: 8/10. Provides personalized assistance and caters to the environment effectively. However, constant monitoring for new hazards could enhance proactiveness, improving user experience.
7. Action Set Alignment: 9/10. Sticks mainly to the listed verbs, but some are missing e.g., securing or affixing (for the lamp cord).

Average Score for code "7_3": 7.57/10.

FSM from code "7_4":

1. State Coverage: 8/10. Covers most states as 7_best, but lacks a comprehensive continuous monitoring state considering future uncertainties.
2. Transition Coverage: 9/10. All states connect logically, but the iteration of the cleaning process isn't clear in transitions.
3. Cyclomatic Complexity: 6/10. Similar to 7_3, limited immediate following states make this FSM less complex.
4. Safety Mindset: 9/10. Safety is considered, but lacks repetitive monitoring to anticipate and resolve new hazards.
5. Scalability: 8/10. This FSM is designed for scaling but, continuous monitoring incorporation would further ease expansion to complex scenarios.
6. Assistance UX: 9/10. This FSM anticipates possible states the robot would encounter and prepares for them, enhancing user experience, but misses the added advantage of continuous monitoring.
7. Action Set Alignment: 10/10. This FSM model strictly adheres to the listed verbs.

Average Score for code "7_4": 8.43/10.

Please note above analysis assumes implementation of the pseudo code provided in the FSM designs. Actual performance may vary with actual implementation and environment dynamics. Also note that both FSMs can likely be improved by incorporating continuous monitoring for new hazards, repetitive cleaning where necessary, and taking advantage of the full action set.
