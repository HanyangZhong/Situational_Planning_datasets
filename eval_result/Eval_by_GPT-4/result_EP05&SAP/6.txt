Scoring for "6_3" FSM:

1. State Coverage: Score 9 - The "6_3" FSM does cover almost all the necessary state coverage, but it does not contain a state for verifying the safety of the area after cleaning the spills. 

2. Transition Coverage: Score 10 - Transitions are covered completely and very well in this FSM code of "6_3". All states are interconnected.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Score 7 - The FSM for "6_3" has modest complexity with a few states following one another. However, it does not have a pervasive interconnectivity.

4. Safety Mindset: Score 8 - Safety is primarily taken into account, but the FSM does not verify the safety of the area after cleaning spills which is a crucial step to ensure safety.

5. Scalability: Score 9 - The FSM structure of "6_3" is simple and not highly complex. This allows for easy adjustments and modifications for potential scenarios. 

6. Assistance UX: Score 7 - The user experience is satisfactory but not very personalised. The FSM does not consider human interaction, for example to communicate the process or the results of its tasks.

7. Action Set Alignment: Score 10 - The FSM uses actions such as collecting and placing down which are part of the set action vocabulary.

Overall Benchmark Score (Average of the seven dimensions): 8.6

Scoring for "6_4" FSM:

1. State Coverage: Score 7 - The "6_4" FSM is missing a state to monitor the area after the tasks have been completed which is needed to detect any further problems.

2. Transition Coverage: Score 8 - The FSM for "6_4" handles state transitions effectively, but a transition to a monitoring state for further vigilance is missing.

3. Cyclomatic Complexity: Score 5 - It contains low interconnectivity with few states having an immediate following state.

4. Safety Mindset: Score 8 - Safety is prioritized but without a state for monitoring after the completion of tasks, it is not certain if the room remains safe.

5. Scalability: Score 7 - The "6_4" FSM is designed to be adaptable to a specific situation, however, it has less flexibility to additional contexts than the "6_3" FSM.

6. Assistance UX: Score 6 - The User experience is reasonable but there's a lack of interaction or update about the robot's task processes.

7. Action Set Alignment: Score 9 - The majority of actions used in "6_4" FSM align with our vocabulary set, but we noticed usage of actions like "closing containers" that does not strictly align with the list.

Overall Benchmark Score (Average of the seven dimensions): 7.1

The "6_3" FSM is closer to the "6_best" FSM compared with "6_4" FSM with higher scores across all presented dimensions, especially in terms of state and transition coverage.
