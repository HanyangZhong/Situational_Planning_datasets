To evaluate the Finite State Machines (FSMs) "14_1" through "14_6" against the benchmark established by "14_best," I will analyze each FSM across the seven specified dimensions: State Coverage, Transition Coverage, Cyclomatic Complexity, Safety Mindset, Scalability, Assistance UX, and Action Set Alignment. Each FSM will be scored on a scale from 0 to 10 for each dimension, and an Overall Benchmark Score will be calculated by averaging these ratings.

### Evaluation Criteria

#### 1. State Coverage
- **Score 10**: All necessary states to handle the scenario are covered.
- **Score 0**: Major gaps in necessary states.

#### 2. Transition Coverage
- **Score 10**: Fully connected transitions, covering all likely sequences.
- **Score 0**: Disconnected transitions and subgraphs.

#### 3. Cyclomatic Complexity
- **Score 10**: Highly interconnected states, each with many following states.
- **Score 0**: Minimal complexity, linear or few connections.

#### 4. Safety Mindset
- **Score 10**: Consistently prioritizes safety, preventing harm.
- **Score 0**: Ignores safety considerations.

#### 5. Scalability
- **Score 10**: Easily extendible to new contexts, encapsulating complexity.
- **Score 0**: Entangled design, resisting modifications.

#### 6. Assistance UX
- **Score 10**: Natural, contextual, and personalized interactions.
- **Score 0**: Robotic, rigid, and impersonal interactions.

#### 7. Action Set Alignment
- **Score 10**: Strict adherence to the industry benchmark list of 56 verbs.
- **Score 0**: No adherence to the action set vocabulary.
