To evaluate the FSMs in the provided code snippets against the benchmark established by "21_best", I'll analyze each FSM across the seven dimensions you've outlined: State Coverage, Transition Coverage, Cyclomatic Complexity, Safety Mindset, Scalability, Assistance UX, and Action Set Alignment. The benchmark FSM, "21_best", sets a high standard with perfect 10s in each category. Let's analyze each FSM in turn:

### 1. ButlerRobotFSM (21_1)

#### State Coverage
- **Score: 6/10**
- The FSM covers essential states like checking the situation, reaching the button, and calling for help. However, it lacks detailed states for injury assessment and comfort, which are present in "21_best".

#### Transition Coverage
- **Score: 7/10**
- Transitions are well connected for the defined states, but it doesn't cover as many scenarios as "21_best".

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- **Score: 4/10**
- Less complex due to fewer states and transitions compared to "21_best".

#### Scalability
- **Score: 6/10**
- More adaptable to different scenarios compared to simpler FSMs.

#### Assistance UX
- **Score: 6/10**
- Better user experience through more specific actions, though still behind "21_best".

#### Action Set Alignment
- **Score: 7/10**
- Good use of the standard action set, but not as exhaustive as "21_best".

#### Overall Benchmark Score
- \(\frac{7+7+5+7+6+6+7}{7} \approx 6.4\)

### 4. ButlerRobotHFSM (21_4)

#### State Coverage
- **Score: 6/10**
- Covers important states but lacks comprehensive coverage like "21_best".

#### Transition Coverage
- **Score: 6/10**
- Reasonably connected transitions but not as thorough as "21_best".

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
- **Score: 4/10**
- Simpler than "21_best" in terms of interconnectivity.

#### Safety Mindset
- **Score: 6/10**
- Focuses on key safety aspects but not as detailed as "21_best".

#### Scalability
- **Score: 5/10**
- Moderately scalable but less so compared to "21_best".

#### Assistance UX
- **Score: 5/10**


- Functional but lacks the nuanced interaction of "21_best".

#### Action Set Alignment
- **Score: 6/10**
- Uses some actions from the standard set but not as comprehensively as "21_best".

#### Overall Benchmark Score
- \(\frac{6+6+4+6+5+5+6}{7} \approx 5.4\)

### 5. ButlerRobotFSM (21_5)

#### State Coverage
- **Score: 6/10**
- Includes unique states like comforting the person but lacks other critical states.

#### Transition Coverage
- **Score: 5/10**
- Adequate transitions but misses some potential scenarios.

#### Cyclomatic Complexity
