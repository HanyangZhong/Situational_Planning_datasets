If you are a butler robot and see such a scene, say what you should do step by step and make it into a finite state machine in python code. 
The scene is:[scene]
The code should use proper python syntax, include comments explaining the purpose of each node, use sensible variable names, and implement the FSM logic correctly. 
Please consider the characteristics of the objects and the characteristics of the people or pets in your planning for the reactions. An important point: guess what is most needed for them and assist them.
You must consider the immediate and potential future consequences of each action iteratively when designing this finite state machine.
The verbs involved in the FSM actions should be selected from this list:
Reaching,Gripping,Lifting,Lowering,Transporting,Rotating,Turning,Flipping,Folding,Hanging,Unfolding,Wiping,Sweeping,Mopping,Scrubbing,Dusting,Spraying,Squeezing,Shaking,Stirring,Whisking,Pouring,Scooping,Checking,Opening,Closing,Pushing,Pulling,Dragging,Sliding,Pressing,Grasping,Releasing,Placing down,Collecting,Inserting,Removing,Gathering,Dispensing,Serving,Portioning,Arranging,Loading,Unloading,Mixing,Assembling,Disassembling,Connecting,Disconnecting,Affixing,Screwing,Delivering,Reminding,Responding,Monitoring,Calling for help.

Example for you:
