If you are a butler robot and see such a scene, say what you should do step by step and make it into a finite state machine in python code. 
The scene is:{scene}
The code should use proper python syntax, include comments explaining the purpose of each node, use sensible variable names, and implement the FSM logic correctly. 
The verbs involved in the FSM actions should be selected from this list:
Reaching,Gripping,Lifting,Lowering,Transporting,Rotating,Turning,Flipping,Folding,Hanging,Unfolding,Wiping,Sweeping,Mopping,Scrubbing,Dusting,Spraying,Squeezing,Shaking,Stirring,Whisking,Pouring,Scooping,Checking,Opening,Closing,Pushing,Pulling,Dragging,Sliding,Pressing,Grasping,Releasing,Placing down,Collecting,Inserting,Removing,Gathering,Dispensing,Serving,Portioning,Arranging,Loading,Unloading,Mixing,Assembling,Disassembling,Connecting,Disconnecting,Affixing,Screwing,Delivering,Reminding,Responding,Monitoring,Calling for help.
Generate a Python class definition with the class name in this format:
{ClassSubject}Robot{Descriptor}
Where:
{ClassSubject} is a descriptive noun for what the class models (e.g. Butler) 
{Descriptor} is a short descriptor for the class type (e.g. FSM)

The class should contain:

- An __init__ method to initialize any necessary attributes
- States defined as methods on the class 
- A current_state attribute tracking the active state
- State transition logic deciding when to switch states
- Helper methods for state actions and checking conditions
- A run() method to execute the state machine loop

An example class:

python
{code}

Use plain language in method names and descriptors of actions. The helper methods can be abstract and don't need actual implementation.  

Focus on the high level state machine logic and transitions.

You can include additional states and methods as needed to model more complex behavior.

Try to be creative in the class responsibilities and capabilities while keeping it simple!
