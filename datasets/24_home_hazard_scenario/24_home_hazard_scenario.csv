Slip and Fall Hazards,Wet floors in bathrooms,level1(potential dangerous£¬no interaction),"The scene is a small, modern bathroom immediately after a shower has been used. The floor is tiled in light blue ceramic, glistening with water droplets that have splashed out from the shower area. A brightly colored bath mat is crumpled against the wall, displaced from its usual spot beside the tub, leaving the area directly in front of the shower exposed and dangerously slippery. The shower curtain, partially open, drips water onto the floor. On the edge of the white porcelain sink, a damp towel is haphazardly left, half-draped over the side, with one end touching the wet floor. Steam still lingers in the air, fogging up the mirror and giving the chrome fixtures a dewy appearance.",0.png,"class BathroomCleanupRobotHFSM:

Slip and Fall Hazards,Wet floors in kitchens,level1(potential dangerous£¬no interaction),"This scene depicts a spacious kitchen with a focus on the hazard posed by a wet floor. In the center of the room, there's a large puddle of clear water mixed with a slick of olive oil, creating a reflective sheen on the dark stone tiles. The source of the spill is evident: an overturned bottle of olive oil lies near the edge of the counter, its cap off, and a pot on the stove shows signs of having boiled over. Sunlight streams through a window, illuminating the spill and making the oily surface glisten. The kitchen is otherwise tidy, with utensils neatly placed and a basket of fresh produce on the counter, contrasting sharply with the mess on the floor. A dog bowl sits in one corner, suggesting the presence of pets. ",1.png,"class ButlerRobotHFSM:

Poisoning Hazards,Unsecured chemicals,level1(potential dangerous£¬no interaction),"This scene is set in a well-lit laundry room. On the floor, a variety of household cleaning products are carelessly left open and within easy reach. There's a bucket with a mop, suggesting recent cleaning activity, but the chlorine bleach bottle next to it is uncapped, and a detergent container is tipped over, its contents slowly oozing out. Shelves above the washing machine hold more chemicals, like fabric softeners and stain removers, with some of their caps loosely placed or missing. The laundry room's door is ajar, suggesting easy access, especially for curious pets or children.

Tripping Hazards,Cluttered walkways,level1(potential dangerous£¬no interaction),"The scene is a narrow hallway in a family home, cluttered in a way that poses a significant tripping hazard. The floor is covered with various items: a pair of sneakers lying askew, a small, overturned toy car, a dog leash coiled in a heap, and a couple of large, hardcover books that appear to have been dropped and left there. The hallway rug is bunched up in one corner, creating an uneven surface. Along one wall, a low-lying shoe rack is overflowing with shoes, some of which have tumbled off and are now part of the obstacle course on the floor. At one end of the hallway, a small table stands with a lamp atop it, its cord snaking across the walkway and contributing to the hazardous setup. The light from the lamp casts shadows over the clutter, making it harder to discern the individual items on the floor, increasing the risk of tripping. The walls are adorned with family photos and children's artwork, suggesting a busy household. The hallway leads to a staircase, the top step barely visible, further emphasizing the danger posed by the cluttered pathway in the event of a fall.",6.png,"class ButlerRobotHFSM:

The drawer, slightly ajar, is filled with various types of knives, including a serrated bread knife, a large chef's knife, and several smaller utility knives. Their blades are haphazardly oriented, some with points and edges facing outward, creating a dangerous situation for anyone reaching in.
Above the drawer, a marble countertop reflects the ambient light, casting a sheen over the metallic surfaces of the knives. Next to the drawer, a cutting board and a half-chopped bell pepper suggest a meal preparation interrupted. The knives' polished handles catch the light, emphasizing their accessibility and the lack of any safety locks or child-proofing mechanisms on the drawer.

Sick people,Access to Medical Supplies,level2(limited interaction),"In this scene, a person suffering from a headache is LYing in bed, appearing weak and unable to get up. Next to the bed, on a small bedside table, is a bottle of medicine that they need. However, due to their weakness and the discomfort from the headache, the person finds it challenging to even sit up and reach the medicine that's just a few inches away.
The bedroom is calm and orderly, with soft lighting that should be conducive to rest. Yet, the person's distress is evident in their attempt to stretch towards the table, their effort hindered by their physical state. The medicine bottle, within sight but frustratingly just out of reach, highlights the struggle faced by sick individuals when they are alone and too unwell to access even nearby items.",10.png,"class ButlerRobotHFSM:

Pregnant Individuals,Fall Prevention,level2(limited interaction),"In this living room, a visibly pregnant woman carefully navigates around potential fall hazards. She is in the later stages of pregnancy, as indicated by her pronounced belly, and moves cautiously across the room. The central area features a large, decorative rug on a sleek hardwood floor. However, the rug's edges are noticeably curled up, creating a tripping hazard that the woman carefully avoids.
The floor is cluttered with various items: children's toys, magazines, and a throw pillow, all of which are potential obstacles in her path. She carefully steps around these items, her movements deliberate and cautious. The room's furniture, including a sofa and a coffee table, is arranged close together, further narrowing the walking space and adding complexity to her navigation.
Bright sunlight streams through a window, illuminating the room but also casting shadows over the rug and clutter, potentially obscuring her view of these hazards. ",11.png,"class ButlerRobotHFSM:

On the counter, there's a knife block with several knives protruding, and a pair of scissors lying next to a cutting board.

The kitchen is otherwise a typical family space, with a fridge covered in colorful magnets and a small table set for a meal. However, the placement of sharp objects within the child's reach creates a significant safety risk.

Elderly people,Emergency Response,level4(complex interaction),"In this living room scene, an elderly person is seated in a recliner, appearing to be in distress and in need of assistance. Across the room, an emergency response system device is placed on a high shelf, well out of reach. The person is trying to get up from the chair, reaching out towards the device, but it's clear they are unable to stand and walk across the room to access it.
The room is comfortably furnished with a couch, a coffee table, and family photos on the walls, creating a cozy atmosphere. However, the placement of the emergency device in a hard-to-reach location poses a significant risk, as the elderly individual cannot easily activate it in case of an emergency.

In this HFSM, the robot first assesses the child's play area to identify any choking hazards. If such hazards are present, the robot removes them and then engages the child with safe toys. The robot continuously monitors the child's play to ensure safety, ready to call for human assistance if needed. This approach prioritizes the child's safety while allowing them to play and explore in a secure environment.",23_HFSM.png
