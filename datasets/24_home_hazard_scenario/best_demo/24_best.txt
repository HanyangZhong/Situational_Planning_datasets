In the scenario where a young child is at risk of choking on small toys, a butler robot must act to ensure the child's safety. Here is a detailed Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) in pseudo-code for this situation:

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # States in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_SITUATION': self.assess_situation_state,
            'REMOVE_HAZARDS': self.remove_hazards_state,
            'ENGAGE_CHILD': self.engage_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # The initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        # Initial monitoring and assessment
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_SITUATION'

    def assess_situation_state(self):
        # Assess the child's interaction with toys
        if self.is_choking_hazard_present():
            self.current_state = 'REMOVE_HAZARDS'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def remove_hazards_state(self):
        # Remove small toys that pose choking hazards
        self.remove_choking_hazards()
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_CHILD'

    def engage_child_state(self):
        # Engage the child with safe toys
        self.provide_safe_toys()
        self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        # Continuously monitor the child's play
        if self.is_child_safe():
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        # Call for human assistance if needed
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions
    def is_choking_hazard_present(self):
        too_close = self.monitoring('child','toys')
        # Check for presence of choking hazards
        return too_close

    def remove_choking_hazards(self):
        self.grasping('danger toys')
        self.placing_down('danger toys', 'safe place')
        # Physically remove small toys that are choking hazards

    def provide_safe_toys(self):
        self.grasping('safe toys')
        self.placing_down('safe toys','child')
        # Offer the child safer toys to play with

    def grasping(self,item):
        # Assess if the child is playing safely
        pass

    def placing_down(self,item,place):
        # Assess if the child is playing safely
        pass

    def is_child_safe(self):
        state = self.monitoring('child')
        # Implement logic to check if the child is safe
        return state

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Call for human help if the situation is beyond the robot's control
        pass

    def run(self):
        # Run the HFSM loop
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the HFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

In this HFSM, the robot first assesses the child's play area to identify any choking hazards. If such hazards are present, the robot removes them and then engages the child with safe toys. The robot continuously monitors the child's play to ensure safety, ready to call for human assistance if needed. This approach prioritizes the child's safety while allowing them to play and explore in a secure environment.
