In the scenario where a small child is playing roughly with a large dog, posing a potential hazard, a butler robot must intervene to ensure safety. Here's a detailed Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) in pseudo-code to manage the situation:

```python
class ButlerRobotHFSM:

    def __init__(self):
        # States in the finite state machine
        self.states = {
            'INITIAL': self.initial_state,
            'ASSESS_INTERACTION': self.assess_interaction_state,
            'CALM_THE_DOG': self.calm_the_dog_state,
            'ENGAGE_THE_CHILD': self.engage_the_child_state,
            'MONITOR_PLAY': self.monitor_play_state,
            'ENSURE_SAFETY': self.ensure_safety_state,
            'CALL_FOR_HELP': self.call_for_help_state
        }
        # The initial state
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def initial_state(self):
        self.current_state = 'ASSESS_INTERACTION'

    def assess_interaction_state(self):
        if self.dog_and_child_interaction_safe():
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALM_THE_DOG'

    def calm_the_dog_state(self):
        self.calming_dog()
        self.current_state = 'ENGAGE_THE_CHILD'

    def engage_the_child_state(self):
        self.engaging_child_away_from_rough_play()
        self.current_state = 'ENSURE_SAFETY'

    def monitor_play_state(self):
        if self.play_becomes_unsafe():
            self.current_state = 'CALM_THE_DOG'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    def ensure_safety_state(self):
        if self.safety_ensured():
            self.current_state = 'MONITOR_PLAY'
        else:
            self.current_state = 'CALL_FOR_HELP'

    def call_for_help_state(self):
        self.calling_for_help()
        self.current_state = 'INITIAL'

    # Helper methods for actions
    def dog_and_child_interaction_safe(self):
        # Assess if interaction between dog and child is safe
        return self.safety_ensured()

    def calming_dog(self, dog):
        self.responding(dog, 'gently')
        # Attempt to calm the cat
        pass

    def engaging_child_away_from_rough_play(self):
        self.responding('child', 'guildence')
        # Engage the child in a safer activity
        pass

    def play_becomes_unsafe(self):
        no_safe = self.monitoring('child') or self.monitoring('dog')
        # Monitor and assess if play becomes unsafe
        return no_safe

    def safety_ensured(self):
        state = self.monitoring('child') and self.monitoring('dog')
        # Implement logic to check if the child is safe
        return state

    def calling_for_help(self):
        # Call for human assistance if needed
        pass

    def responding(self,item,action):
        pass

    def monitoring(self,item):
        pass

    def run(self):
        # Run the HFSM loop
        while True:
            self.states[self.current_state]()

# Create an instance of the HFSM and run it
butler_robot = ButlerRobotHFSM()
butler_robot.run()
```

#In this HFSM, the robot first assesses the interaction between the dog and the child. If it deems the play unsafe, it intervenes to calm the dog and engage the child in safer activities. The robot continuously monitors the play, ensuring safety, and calls for human assistance if the situation becomes unmanageable. The robot's actions prioritize the child's safety while trying to maintain a playful and positive environment.
