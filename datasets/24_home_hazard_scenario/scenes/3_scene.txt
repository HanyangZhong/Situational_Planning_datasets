In a cozy study room, a lit candle sits precariously on a crowded wooden bookshelf. The candle, halfway melted, is positioned dangerously close to a pile of old, hardcover books. The flame flickers, casting a warm, yet ominous glow on the surrounding volumes, some with visibly dry, aged pages that could easily catch fire. Nearby, a pair of reading glasses and a forgotten cup of tea suggest recent human activity, but the room is now deserted. The candle is in a thin holder, offering little protection against the growing wax pool which threatens to overflow.
