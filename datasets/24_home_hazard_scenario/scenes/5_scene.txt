In a small bathroom, a medicine cabinet hangs open, revealing an array of unsecured medication bottles, pillboxes, and prescription packets. Some of the bottles are open, with pills spilling out onto the lower shelves and a few dropping to the counter below. Among the medications, there are brightly colored capsules and tablets, which could be mistaken for candy by children. Next to the medicine cabinet, a small sink reflects the disarray in its mirror, emphasizing the accessibility of these potentially dangerous substances. On the counter, there's a toothbrush holder and a soap dispenser, indicating frequent use of the space, increasing the risk of accidental ingestion. The lighting in the bathroom is soft, casting a gentle glow on the chaotic cabinet contents, underscoring the silent threat posed by these unsecured medications.
