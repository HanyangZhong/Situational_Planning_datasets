In this living room, a visibly pregnant woman carefully navigates around potential fall hazards. She is in the later stages of pregnancy, as indicated by her pronounced belly, and moves cautiously across the room. The central area features a large, decorative rug on a sleek hardwood floor. However, the rug's edges are noticeably curled up, creating a tripping hazard that the woman carefully avoids.
The floor is cluttered with various items: children's toys, magazines, and a throw pillow, all of which are potential obstacles in her path. She carefully steps around these items, her movements deliberate and cautious. The room's furniture, including a sofa and a coffee table, is arranged close together, further narrowing the walking space and adding complexity to her navigation.
Bright sunlight streams through a window, illuminating the room but also casting shadows over the rug and clutter, potentially obscuring her view of these hazards.
