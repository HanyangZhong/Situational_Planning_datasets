In this home study, a clear mobility challenge is presented: a person in a wheelchair is positioned at the entrance, facing an office chair that has been left carelessly in the middle of the room, blocking the path to the desk. The wheelchair user, ready to work or study, appears momentarily halted by this obstacle.
The study itself is neatly arranged with a desk against the far wall, flanked by bookshelves filled with books and a filing cabinet to the side. The desk is set up for use, with a computer and some papers neatly placed on it. However, the thoughtlessly placed office chair in the center of the room creates a barrier, preventing direct access from the doorway to the desk.
The room is brightly lit, with sunlight streaming through a window and illuminating the space, casting a shadow of the wheelchair onto the floor. This lighting also highlights the obstructive office chair, underscoring the ease with which it could be moved.
