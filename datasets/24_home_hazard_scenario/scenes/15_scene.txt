In this cozy living room, a few pet-proofing oversights create hazards that can be quickly fixed. A curious cat is eyeing a loosely covered electrical outlet near the floor, posing a risk of shock. On a low shelf, a potted plant that is toxic to pets is within easy reach of the cat. Nearby, a small toy with detachable parts is left on the rug, posing a choking hazard for the cat. 
The living room is otherwise inviting, with comfortable furniture and warm lighting.
