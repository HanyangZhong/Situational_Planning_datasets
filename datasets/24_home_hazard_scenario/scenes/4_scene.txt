The scene is set in a modern kitchen where a small gas stove flame burns unattended. The flame is low but steady, heating an empty, slightly scorched saucepan. Around the stove are various cooking ingredients ¨C an oil bottle with its cap off, a dish towel haphazardly thrown nearby, and a wooden cutting board with chopped vegetables. These items are perilously close to the open flame, posing a significant fire risk. Above the stove, the extractor fan is switched off, and the window is closed, preventing the dispersal of heat or gas build-up. The lighting in the kitchen is dim, with the stove's blue flame casting an eerie light on the metallic surfaces, emphasizing the solitary danger of the forgotten flame.
