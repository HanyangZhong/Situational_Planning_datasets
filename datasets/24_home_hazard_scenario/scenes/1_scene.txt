The scene is a small, modern bathroom immediately after a shower has been used. The floor is tiled in light blue ceramic, glistening with water droplets that have splashed out from the shower area. A brightly colored bath mat is crumpled against the wall, displaced from its usual spot beside the tub, leaving the area directly in front of the shower exposed and dangerously slippery. The shower curtain, partially open, drips water onto the floor. On the edge of the white porcelain sink, a damp towel is haphazardly left, half-draped over the side, with one end touching the wet floor. Steam still lingers in the air, fogging up the mirror and giving the chrome fixtures a dewy appearance.
